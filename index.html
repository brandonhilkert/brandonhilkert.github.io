		<p><em>A variation of this post originally appeared on the <a href="http://railsmasterclass.com/">Rails Masterclass</a>
newsletter.</em></p>

<p>Learning new technologies can be a challenge. With books, forums, videos, blog
posts&hellip;where do you start?!?! I&rsquo;ve used all these resources in the past and
only one thing has reliably led to me to really learn the concepts &ndash; building something REAL!</p>

<h3>How I learned Ruby and Rails</h3>

<p>Several years ago, I was learning both <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>
and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and trying to figure out which books were
worth the time. I ended up starting with <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4">Agile Web Development with
Rails</a>,
which was a fantastic introduction to the features and benefits you&rsquo;ll get from
learning the Rails framework. However, like many other books, it guides you
through building a website with little real world value &ndash; an e-commerce
shopping cart (you&rsquo;ve heard this one before, right???).  The concepts in the
book generally apply to other products built with Rails, but it was sometimes
hard for me to see their value elsewhere.  I found that the books and articles often skipped over things that were fairly
trivial for a more experienced developer, but essential to get a real world application out the door.</p>

<h3>The best way to learn (with a catch)</h3>

<p>I propose you build something&hellip;anything really. But it would be more useful if
the thing you build is useful to either you, someone else, or even
better&hellip;everyone! But there&rsquo;s a catch&hellip;whatever you build, you must not only
put it out there for the world to see, but you must share it in whatever way
you feel comfortable.</p>

<h3>My Craigslist Scraper</h3>

<p>A few years ago, I was in the market for a new job. I built a small Craigslist
scraper that searched for &ldquo;my perfect job&rdquo; and had it notify me via email
whenever it found a similar post.</p>

<p>The process of creating this little scraper did two things for me. First, it
allowed me to learn (I wrote it in Perl and at the time knew very little about
the language&hellip;). And second, it saved the 15 minutes or so it would take me
each day to sift through the new job postings. It really was a win-win!</p>

<h3>Start to Finish</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to copy and paste code snippets from a blog post or book. It&rsquo;s much
harder to see these applications through to the point where they&rsquo;re useful. Who
cares if no one uses it? The value you get from seeing your application code
all the way to the point of production is exponentially greater than the value
of having run &ldquo;rails server&rdquo; on your local development machine.</p>

<p>Questions such as &ldquo;How will I log and be notified of errors?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How will I
backup my production data store?&rdquo; take time and thought to answer.</p>

<p>There are so many easy to use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PAAS</a> platforms
now-a-days, even if you&rsquo;re not the devops guru that you aspire to be, you too
can have production code running with minimal effort for FREE!
<a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> is a great example of a place that you can
host your Rails applications without hassle or cost. If you have an application
running locally that you&rsquo;d like to share, hosting it at Heroku is a no-brainer.</p>

<p>If you have more aspirational goals of managing servers and understanding what
makes a Rails application tick, servers at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital
Ocean</a>, <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a>, and
<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a> can be extremely cost effective.</p>

<h3>Dogfooding</h3>

<p>Building an application that can save you time in your daily routine (ie. task
tracker, appt. reminder, etc.) is a great first step to learning more. It&rsquo;s
also very possible that if the application helps you, it could help other
people. I&rsquo;ll leave the marketing talk for another time, but stepping back and
being an actual user of your application will cause you to look at it in a very
different light. It&rsquo;s likely that you&rsquo;ll find ways to drastically improve your
application within the first 10 minutes of usage.</p>

<h3>Sharing (this is my favorite part)</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ve now spent several weeks/months building something interesting &ndash; tell the
world about it. Tweet about it, post it to your local user group mailing list,
email your friends, anything&hellip;the more people that see it, the better. Like
dogfooding, you&rsquo;ll get valuable feedback that you might not have gotten
otherwise.</p>

<p>I can hear all the perfectionists now&hellip;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to share it until it&rsquo;s
perfect&rdquo;. Having worked on a number of large applications, the candid truth is
that it will <strong>NEVER</strong> be perfect. The feedback you&rsquo;ll get sooner is more
valuable than the time you&rsquo;ll waste by attempting perfection. Besides, I have a
feeling that most the features you thought you <em>had</em> to have before you
launched are unimportant to the people that actually want to use your
application.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a more subtle point to sharing your new application&hellip;subconsciously
you&rsquo;re likely not going to share something that you think is crappy. If your
goal is to ultimately share what you&rsquo;ve built, you&rsquo;ll put the work in to make
it worthy of sharing, and in the process, learn about the finer details of
releasing a web application in to the wild, not just a basic shopping cart that
has minimal real-world value.</p>

<h3>Where to go from here?</h3>

<p>Knowing what you want to build is easier said than done. I keep a list of ideas
that I ultimately want to build someday. Some have very little use outside my
own world and others probably have potential to be used by other people, but
either way, bringing these ideas to life with new technologies or concepts
really helps me to solidify their real-world value.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have ideas, a quick Google search for &ldquo;startup ideas&rdquo; will provide
you with some very interesting results. However, I&rsquo;d think about the things
you&rsquo;re doing everyday and ask yourself if any of them can be solved, or aided,
with software. If the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to any of them, you have yourself a great
candidate.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear about what you&rsquo;re building and the challenges you&rsquo;re facing.</p>

		<p>One of the simplest and most common application of
background processing is sending emails outside of a web
request. And while background processing is pretty
common, Ruby libraries require an additional background
process to execute jobs. The application I was working on
was hosted on Heroku, and the cost of adding an
additional dyno is $35/month. The background jobs did
very little more than send emails the current solutions
seemed like overkill to me. So
<a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch">sucker_punch</a>
was born&hellip;</p>

<h3>Ruby Background Processing Libraries</h3>

<p>Until I had heard of Sidekiq,
<a href="https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job/tree/master">delayed_job</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/resque/resque">Resque</a> were the
standard options for processing background jobs in Ruby.
I&rsquo;ve used both and believe each has a great use case.</p>

<p>My experience is that it&rsquo;s easiest to start with
delayed_job and if you get to the point where the DB is
your bottleneck, it&rsquo;s time to move on. Redis is a
dependency of both Resque and Sidekiq, so it requires
more infrastructure and care to maintain, however, with
<a href="https://addons.heroku.com/?q=redis">Heroku&rsquo;s hosted Redis
Add-ons</a>, this
dependency is much less of a pain any more.</p>

<h3>My work on Sidekiq</h3>

<p>I previously wrote about my my <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/3-ways-to-get-started-contributing-to-open-source/">open source
contributions</a>
and how I got started. I had spent the previous several
months contributing to Sidekiq and learning more about
concurrency patterns in Ruby.</p>

<p>Sidekiq is multi-threaded, which is the reason a single
Sidekiq process is <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Testimonials">more
efficient</a>.
However, care must be taken to ensure your jobs are
thread-safe. A helpful <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Best-Practices">guide to writing thread-safe
code</a>
can be found on the Sidekiq wiki.</p>

<h3>My Use Case</h3>

<p>I was working on <a href="http://defriendnotifierapp.com/">Defriend
Notifier</a> and needed to
notify users via email when their Facebook friend list
changed. Using Sidekiq or any of the alternatives
mentioned above would have worked for my use. In fact,
the application originally did use Sidekiq and worked
perfectly. However, I was looking for ways to reduce the
hosting cost of the application given that it doesn&rsquo;t
produce any revenue stream outside of advertising.</p>

<p>The only background processing library that doesn&rsquo;t
require an additional background process is
<a href="https://github.com/mperham/girl_friday">girl_friday</a>,
also written by <a href="https://twitter.com/mperham">Mike
Perham</a>, author of Sidekiq.
While this solution worked for awhile, I found the syntax
to be slightly non-intuitive and it felt a little dirty
to pass around a global variable within the application
to manage a single job queue. I also experienced some
memory leaks on Heroku as a result of switching to
girl_friday, but to be fair, I didn&rsquo;t spend much time
determining the root cause. It&rsquo;s very likely it could
have been code that I wrote.</p>

<h3>Celluloid</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid">Celluloid</a>
describes itself as an actor-based concurrent object
framework for Ruby. Celluloid is the guts behind Sidekiq
and the reason why the multi-threaded Sidekiq code is so
readable. Celluloid abstracts away the details of
concurrency so that the library code doesn&rsquo;t have to
worry about manually managing thread synchronization and
object message queuing.</p>

<h3>sucker_punch is born</h3>

<p>girl_friday was written several years previous, before
Celluloid was created. Realizing the power of Celluloid,
I figured there was an opportunity for a new library that
essentially behaved like girl_friday, but utilized
Celluloid&rsquo;s more reliable multi-threading capabilities.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/brandonhilkert/status/292630123981729793">tweeted at Mike
Perham</a>
and his response was enough to affirm my interest.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Celluloid had all of the functionality
needed for background queues already built-in. While the
functionality was there, the usage syntax was a little
awkward given that it wasn&rsquo;t primary usage for the
framework.</p>

<p>I spent the next few days creating a DSL around the
Celluloid internals, thus making it feel more specific to
background queues.</p>

<p>Here is a typical job class:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example sucker_punch job class</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">LogJob</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="ss">SuckerPunch</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Job</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">perform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">event</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1"># do some other stuff to</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1"># record the event in the background</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">event</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> just happened&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I deployed the sucker_punch-converted code to production
and gave it a week or so before I declared it a success.
Once I realized sucker_punch was going to be a
maintainable method for processing background jobs in a
single web process, I added additional niceties like
logging and queue configuration details that may be
valuable for other use cases.</p>

<p>Have you tried sucker_punch yet? If so, I&rsquo;d love to know how it went and what you used it for&hellip;</p>

		<p>Towards the end of 2012, I began feeling like a had a good grip on the Ruby
language. As mentioned in a <a href="/blog/the-technology-hump/">previous
post</a>, I felt confident enough in my skills that
I could make a positive contribution to the open source community.</p>

<p>I learned a lot by watching certain projects and getting involved with others
and hope that my notes are helpful for you and your endeavors.</p>

<h3>1. Fix a bug in an existing gem because it affects you</h3>

<p>My experience with <a href="/about">Meeteor</a> and <a href="/about">Spokely</a> caused me to move
FAST and break a lot of things along the way. Because of the pace, when I did
find a bug, I wasn&rsquo;t great at contributing code back to the source repository.
In many cases, my fixes were brute force <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey
patches</a> or something else that I
would probably be pretty embarassed about today.</p>

		<p>Last weekend, I finished an
<a href="http://www.tricolumbia.org/events/chesapeakeman-endurance-festival/">Ironman</a>.
The training consumed valuable time with both family and friends that I&rsquo;ll
never get back. However, the support and love that I received on the days
surrounding the race have given me an increased appreciation for the people
that are in my life and the unwavering support they offer.</p>

<p>Finishing the race was an incredible experience. The day of the race had its
share of extreme ups and downs, both of which I&rsquo;ve come to value now that it&rsquo;s
over. Since I no longer have to worry about waking up at 5 a.m. to get to gym,
I&rsquo;ve spent a fair amount of time replaying the past 30 weeks and the sacrifices
involved.</p>

		<p>For the past few years, I&rsquo;ve spent most of my waking moments either reading about or writing code. For me, it&rsquo;s about the constant pursuit of learning and getting better at my craft. In hindsight, I can say that that mentality has helped me have a leg up on the competition (for reasons I will detail in future posts).</p>

<h3>Rewind 4 years</h3>

<p>Four years ago I was writing PHP on the side for startups and just getting into software products as both a profession and hobby (more on this too&hellip;). I had reached a level of comfort with PHP where I knew I could solve just about any business problem thrown at me. This feeling was not only comforting, but empowering. Shortly after, I helped create <a href="/about">Meeteor</a>, which was written in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and my world took turn for the better.</p>
