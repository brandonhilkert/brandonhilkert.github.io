      <h1 class="text-center">&#8220;I can’t differentiate my website visitors&#8221;</h1>

      <p>Showing your website visitors the same newsletter subscription form <strong>OVER</strong> and
        <strong>OVER</strong> is not so bad, is it?</p>

      <p class="text-center"><em>&#8230;only when the visitors are already subscribed.</em></p>

      <p>You’re wasting <strong>precious website real estate</strong> on offers your visitors
      have already seen. <em>Seems a little impersonal, doesn&#8217;t it???</em>
      </p>


      <p>Email newsletters are a great way to keep in touch with your audience and build
      trust with them over time. Once you have their trust and interest, it’s natural
      to offer them something more &#8211; it could be an email course or white paper, or even
      a book or service you&#8217;ve created.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, once you offer more than one product or newsletter, it’s hard to pinpoint
        exactly where your visitors are in your sales funnel when they&#8217;re navigating your website.
      </p>


      <p>
      Right now, you could be showing that visitor that’s already subscribed to your
      website AND email course -  a discount code for your latest book. All because
      you know where they are in your sales funnel and where they’ve shown interest
      in the past. Sounds perfect, right? Sadly, you can’t find anything to help you
      do this.
      </p>

      <p>
      But what if you could? What if you could provide your website visitors with
      special offers and target messaging depending on what they’ve seen and
      interacted with in the past? Could be a discount code, a white paper, or even a
      personalize message thanking them for being so awesome!
      </p>

      <p>
      Your website visitors don’t have to be an impersonal mystery.
      </p>


      <p>
      With my Marketing Intelligence service, you no longer have to waste precious
      real estate on your website for offers a visitor has already taken advantage
      of. Send them through your sales funnel and take knowing they’re previous
      behavior, so you can show them the most relevant offers for THEM.
