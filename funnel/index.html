      <h1 class="text-center">&#8220;I can’t differentiate my website visitors&#8221;</h1>

      <p>Showing your website visitors the same newsletter subscription form <strong>OVER</strong> and
        <strong>OVER</strong> is not so bad, is it?</p>

      <p class="text-center"><em>&#8230;only when the visitors are already subscribed.</em></p>


      <p>Email newsletters are a great way to keep in touch with your audience and build
      trust with them over time. Once you have their trust and interest, it’s natural
      to offer them something more &#8211; it could be an email course or white paper, or even
      a book or service you&#8217;ve created.
      </p>

      <p>So why are you wasting <strong>precious website real estate</strong> on offers your visitors
      have <strong>already seen</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="text-center">
        <em>Seems a little impersonal, doesn&#8217;t it???</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The truth is, once you offer more than one product or newsletter, it’s hard to pinpoint
        exactly where your visitors are in your funnel and provide them <strong>a unique and valuable
        experience</strong> when they <strong>come back to your website</strong>. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be&#8230;
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now, you could be showing that visitor already subscribed to your
        newsletter and email course &#8211; a discount code for your latest book. All because
        <strong>you know EXACTLY where they are in your funnel</strong> based on their past behavior.
        And why not??? They already trust you and have signed up or bought one of your products already.
        Sounds perfect, right? Sadly, you can’t find anything to help you do this.
      </p>

      <p>
        But what if you could? What if you could provide your visitors with
        <strong>special offers and target messaging</strong> depending on what they’ve seen and
        bought from you (or signed up for messaging) in the past? Could be a discount code, a white paper,
        or even a personalize message thanking them for being so awesome!
      </p>

      <p class="text-center">
        <strong>
          Your website visitors don’t have to be an impersonal mystery.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        With my Funnel Optimizer service, you no longer have to waste precious
        website real estate on offers a visitor has already taken advantage
        of. Send them through <strong>YOUR</strong> funnel &#8211; all while converting and
        selling more of your own products&#8230;to customers that clearly already value your work. Everybody wins.
