        Have you ever signed up for the same mailing list twice?
      </h1>

      <p>
        No&#8230;and neither have your readers. Showing your subscribers the
        same newsletter form <strong>OVER</strong> and <strong>OVER</strong>
        doesn&#8217;t get you any more subscribers. And it certainly doesn&#8217;t offer
        <em>them</em> any more value.

        Not convinced yet? No problem&#8230;let&#8217;s dig in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Email newsletters are a great way to keep in touch with your audience
        and build trust with them over time. Here&#8217;s what your current blog funnel probably look like:
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="/images/funnel/bad-funnel-annotated.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Bad blog funnel"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        Showing the same signup form to those already subscribed does them no good!
        This is essentially what you&#8217;re saying them:
      </p>

      <p class="text-center text-muted">
        <em>
          &#8220;Hi there. Me again. I think you might have subscribed to my mailing list, but why not do it again?
          Besides, you&#8217;re no different than anyone else that shows up to my website. Sorry&#8230; :(&#8221;
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Once they&#8217;re subscribed and you have their trust and interest, itâ€™s natural
        to offer them something more &#8211; could be an email course or white paper, or even
        a book or service you&#8217;ve created.
      </p>

      <p>What if your funnel, <em>instead</em>, looked like this?</p>

      <p>
        <img src="/images/funnel/good-funnel.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Good blog funnel"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        NOW, the conversation goes like this:
      </p>

      <p class="text-center text-muted">
        <em>
          &#8220;Hi there. Me again. I noticed you&#8217;re subscribed to my mailing list&#8230;thank you. Because of this,
          I&#8217;d like to offer you a FREE 5-day course on how to better market to your customers.&#8221;
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Seems obvious, right? So why are you wasting precious website real estate on products and offers
        your readers have already seen???
      </p>

      <p>
        Truth is, once you offer more than one product or newsletter, it&#8217;s hard to pinpoint
        exactly where your customers are in your funnel. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be&#8230;
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now, you could be showing that loyal fan already subscribed to your
        newsletter and email course &#8211; a discount code for your latest book, or even a message
        thanking them for being so awesome! All because <strong>you know EXACTLY where they are
        in your funnel</strong> based on their past behavior. Your website visitors
        don&#8217;t have to be an impersonal mystery.
      </p>

      <p>
        With <strong>Funnel Optimizer</strong>, you no longer have to show your
        customers the same offers over and over again. Send them through your
        funnel &#8211; all while converting and selling more of your own
        products&#8230;to loyal customers that already value your work. Everybody wins.
