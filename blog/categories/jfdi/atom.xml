<p>I&rsquo;m tired. Getting up around 5am all week has worn on me. Yesterday I felt like
zombie&hellip;and it was mostly my own fault because I didn&rsquo;t make it a priority to
get bed a decent hour.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about you, but I function best with 7-8 hours of sleep. I
generally can&rsquo;t sleep longer than 8, and anything less than 7 is OK for a
day or two, otherwise, it catches up with me. I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going
on here&hellip;</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Having realized this, I got to sleep last night around 9:30pm. I figured I&rsquo;d
sleep in until 6am or so, but naturally woke up around 5:15am. So while I&rsquo;m
feeling better this morning, I&rsquo;m still feeling the side effects of not getting
enough sleep from the first few days of the week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of this for the rest of the week and see if I can get
back to a normal (whatever that means!).</p>

<h3>What I Accomplished Today</h3>

<p>Like the previous days, I was able to write Day 4 of the Build a Ruby Gem Email
Course. I had a bit of trouble getting in to the flow of writing this morning.
I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s due to the lack of sleep mentioned above, or just a little
speed bump in the normal creative process. It took 15 min. or so until I felt
like words were coming out naturally.</p>

<h3>Changes to the Email Course</h3>

<p>On Day 3, I realized I hadn&rsquo;t gotten to the meat of the Ruby gem and was still
writing about important, but somewhat theoretical topics. It occurred to me that
it&rsquo;s probably best not to cut the content, but rather, extend the course. So
instead of a 5-day course, it might be 6 or 7. My goal is write the best content possible and if after 7 days, I
feel like I&rsquo;ve covered the topic thoroughly, I&rsquo;ll wrap it up.</p>

<p>One thought that has crossed my mind is removing some of the content for an
ebook. I could make the course somewhat abbreviated, while offering the book as
an up-sell to those interested in the details. I&rsquo;ll think about this some more
and once the course content shakes out.</p>

<p>Additionally , I thinking about spreading the course out. So rather than
send 1 email a day, shoot for every 2-3 days, so that I can market the course as
a 14 or 21-day email course. I also feel like the people that will get the most
value out of the content  would benefit from extra time in between each lesson.</p>

<h3>Marketing</h3>

<p>Visits were slightly down yesterday, and I suspect the allure of the announcement has worn off.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/ga-day4.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics day 4 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Thinking more about it, I&rsquo;ve not been great at seeking out marketing channels
for people that might be a good fit for the course. I&rsquo;ve been posting to the
same channels, which has produced a decreasing level of interest over the past
4 days. Truthfully, I&rsquo;m pretty worn out by the time I finish the email course
lesson and this update post, so it&rsquo;s difficult to get worked up for that. But
I&rsquo;ll think more about it and report back.</p>

<p>The mailing list is up to 82 subscribers, so while the growth is slowing, it&rsquo;s
still a 10% lift over the previous day. This, too, probably reiterates my need
to find users elsewhere.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/mailchimp-day4.png" title="&ldquo;Mailchimp day 4 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>I setup the subscription form to track what page the user was on when they
subscribed. Subscriptions are coming from all over the place. It appears that even after 4 days, people are
still landing on the first post of the series and converting.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/mailchimp-conversion-sources-day4.png" title="&ldquo;Mailchimp conversion sources for day 4&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Again, Reddit appears to be the best source for both traffic and conversions.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/sources-day4.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics day 4 traffic sources&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Once the email course is live, I&rsquo;ll make a better effort to market the landing
page elsewhere. I think these updates may be better suited for a different
target audience anyway.</p>

<p>The end is near!</p>

<p>I let myself sleep in until 5:30am this morning ;) I spent a few very
unsuccessful hours wrestling with Wordpress last night and didn&rsquo;t get to bed at
the time I wanted. However, all is well. I was able to push out Day 4 of the
Build a Ruby Gem Email Course without issue.</p>

<p>One of the things that I&rsquo;m noticing about putting the course posts together is
how much the content relies on outside resources. Whether it&rsquo;s an external URL,
the output of a command prompt, or a diff on Github&hellip;getting those together is
a non-trivial amount of time.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>A side effect of getting up early is that by 7:30am (when I&rsquo;ve typically finish
this post), I feel really productive. At this point, I&rsquo;ve worked for 2 straight
hours, all of which have been highly focused. So at 7:30am, I take a break, get
some breakfast and take a shower and &ldquo;start&rdquo; the rest of my day. It feels like
the day starts out on a better foot as a result.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also found that I&rsquo;ve been able to focus better early in the morning vs.
later at night. I know this is personal thing, some people do their best work
in the wee hours of the night. Not me, I&rsquo;m a morning person and have embraced
it. My productivity in the morning is probably 2-3x that of my normal
productivity during the day. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m refreshed or
fewer distractions (it&rsquo;s dark, no TV, no social media, no other windows
open&hellip;).</p>

<h3>What I Accomplished Today</h3>

<p>I pushed out the latest day of the email course. I feel like it&rsquo;s just starting
to get in to the thick of things. I&rsquo;ve been really sensitive to the fact that
not every person that takes the course will be a Ruby veteran. Hopefully the
detailed discussions on load paths and basic installations won&rsquo;t detract from
the value for those that are.</p>

<p>Yesterday I mentioned the non-optimal formatting of my email campaigns on
mobile devices. I spent some time with Mailchimp last night and applied a more
responsive template to the campaign. It&rsquo;s better, but still somewhat finicky in
the iOS Gmail app. I&rsquo;ve sent a support request and hopefully I&rsquo;ll have that
ironed out soon. But for those on every other platform, you should&rsquo;ve had a
much better reading experience!</p>

<h3>Marketing</h3>

<p>As I expected, the growth of both the mailing list and page views slowed down a bit.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/ga-day3.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics day 3 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>I got a 15% bump in mailing list subscriptions, which is better than nothing!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/mailchimp-day3.png" title="&ldquo;Mailchimp day 3 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sending the daily update campaigns at 8pm. I didn&rsquo;t put much thought in to
this time, other than the fact that I stumbled on an email marketing post that
suggested the hours between 8-12am get the best open rates. According to the
campaign report, the open rate is doing well, as compared with the average.
However, I have a tendency to believe it&rsquo;s more due to the nature of the
opted-in target audience. This is a very specific topic that people
specifically wanted to read about. So it makes sense to me that the open rate
would be pretty high.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/campaign-day3.png" title="&ldquo;Mailchimp day 3 campaign report&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Reddit continues to be a positive source of traffic. I had haphazardly posted
to Reddit in the past, but it&rsquo;s been driving more traffic than any other
source. Along with views, it&rsquo;s also yielded one of the highest conversion rates
for the mailing list. So I&rsquo;ll continue to post my updates there.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/sources-day3.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics day 3 traffic sources&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Until tomorrow&hellip;</p>

<h3>Back at it</h3>

<p>I hit the 5:00am goal this morning! It&rsquo;s 6:15am and I&rsquo;ve wrapped up the 2nd day of
the Build a Ruby Gem Email Course.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I had some anxiety about the amount of writing involved in putting
this course together. I&rsquo;ve read a number of blog posts about building a Ruby
gem, but most seem to assume you have a pretty in depth knowledge of creating
gems, while others skip important details of the process. So I knew going in to
it that I wanted to write about it a little differently. I wanted to talk more
about theory of why things are being done vs. how the Ruby language works.</p>

<p>Thinking back to my first Ruby gem, I remember my frustration trying to
understand the conventions of naming and file structure. So I&rsquo;m writing the course I
wish I had when I started.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Flow</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s been 3 days since I started documenting this process and the writing
process has gotten significantly easier. Since I started my blog, I&rsquo;ve read a
number of posts recommending the value of writing every day, regardless of the
subject. I&rsquo;m beginning to see the benefit of this consistency. I&rsquo;ll report back
on this by the end of the week as it should be even more apparent by then.</p>

<h3>What I Accomplished today</h3>

<p>I wrote Day 2 of the Build a Ruby Gem Email Course. The content organization
that I did on the first day has proved to be valuable. Outside of moving a few
topics around, it&rsquo;s stayed largely in tact. So here&rsquo;s to organization!!!</p>

<p>I think I also solved my email list problems. Actually, it was less &ldquo;problems&rdquo;, and
more, I need to learn how to use <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a>. I was in touch with their support
over an issue around signing up for multiple lists. I originally had the
subscriptions to the Week of Hustle updates going to my personal newsletter
list. This caused a semi-alarming error message if you were already on the
list.</p>

<p>The solution was to create a separate list and manage it outside of the realm
of my newsletter. Despite seeming over-complicated at first, I now feel
comfortable with this solution and I think it actually fits my goals better.
I&rsquo;ve already started to think of the best way to manage the email course once
it&rsquo;s live.</p>

<h3>What I&rsquo;m working on today</h3>

<p>A few people have pointed out some oddities with the formatting of my email
updates and there are a few design changes I&rsquo;d like to make on the sign up
forms. However, because the email updates are going out daily, it&rsquo;s my first
priority.</p>

<p>There have been no changes to the timeline I posted yesterday, and still feel
like I&rsquo;m on schedule to finish by the end of the weekend!</p>

<h3>Marketing</h3>

<p>I was originally worried that the buzz surrounding the course and my updates
about the process would die off and I&rsquo;d get another couple people throughout
the week. This appears to not be the case. However, I&rsquo;m not convinced it&rsquo;ll
continue this way throughout the week.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/ga-day2.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics day 2 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>As you can see, traffic to the blog was almost exactly the same as the previous
day (Sunday).</p>

<p>I screwed up the Google Analytics tracking code on the layouts, so I wasn&rsquo;t
tracking email list conversions until late last night. But the good news is
that according to Mailchimp, I signed up another 25 subscribers to the updates list.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/mailchimp-day2.png" title="&ldquo;Mailchimp day 2 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>This is down from the previous day, but overall, I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. I did
get a little boost because I sent a campaign about the course and my updates to
my newsletter email list, which seemed to account for maybe 8-10 subscriptions.</p>

<p>See you tomorrow!</p>

</p>

<p>Alright, back at it! I didn&rsquo;t quite hit the
5:00am goal I had, but was early enough to accomplish
what I was shooting for. (Setting my alarm for
11:58pm because namecheap.com had hourly Cyber Monday
coupon codes didn&rsquo;t help&hellip;).</p>

<h3>What I Accomplished today</h3>

<p>Today I wrote the first post out of 5 and it went
relatively smooth. Yesterday I created a rough outline
for the course content using
<a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>. I&rsquo;ve used it mainly as
a place to spew out the ideas that are not necessarily
organized, but just general notes about things I want to
make sure get covered (imagine that, using Evernote for
notes?!?!).</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Writing my entry for the email course caused me to
realize that I had to make a few changes to my blog to
facilitate the course (ie. hide newsletter signup at the
end of each course). Those changes probably took 10-15
min. However, I got them out of the way so I won&rsquo;t have
to worry about it anymore for future courses (I know, fat
chance a web developer leaves something alone for very
long&hellip;).</p>

<h3>What I&rsquo;m working on</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s been some weirdness with my Mailchimp sign up
form, mostly around signing up for multiple groups as an
existing recipient. I&rsquo;ve submitted a support request and
have been reaching out to people that are far more
knowledgable than I using email lists and hope to have it
resolved by the end of the day, at which point I&rsquo;ll notify my existing
email list of the course.</p>

<h3>My new timeline</h3>

<p>I made a few changes/additions to my project timeline as
you can see below:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><del>Day 1 &ndash; Overall topic and organize what content goes on which days, setup GH
project and ready tags, write WOH day blog, why gem discussion (ref. open
source blog &ndash; pics of GA)</del></p></li>
<li><p><del>Day 2 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</del></p></li>
<li><p>Day 3 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 4 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 5 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 6 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 7 &ndash;  Setup auto responder and way to capture for the course, write emails for each day of sequence (depending on the content). Proofread all course posts.</p></li>
<li><p>Day 8 &ndash; Launch with new landing page and notify subscribers</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I realized I needed to separate out time to proofread previous email course
content posts. After writing for over an hour, I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m in the
best position to be critical of my writing. I think editing after the fact will
also reveal some places where content can be removed due to wordiness.</p>

<h3>Marketing</h3>

<p>I wanted to add a marketing section to each of these updates because building
an audience is such a critical piece of this process. Yesterday, I posted my
<a href="/blog/build-a-ruby-gem-woh-day-1/">Day 1</a> post around the internet and got
overwhelmingly positive feedback.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;sign up for updates&rdquo; form yielded around 40 subscriptions. My wife and I
went to the movies yesterday and at one point I looked at my phone and saw
this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/mailbox.png" title="&ldquo;My mailbox showing Mailchimp subscriptions&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Yesterday I mentioned part of my motivation for launching this <strong>Build a Ruby
Gem</strong> email course was to determine if there was enough interest in the topic
to warrant an ebook. So far, so good&hellip;</p>

<p>Total visits to the site was 337. I&rsquo;ll take a 10% conversion rate any day!</p>

<p>Living outside a major metropolitan area has made it hard to surround myself
with other entrepreneurs. Fortunately, the internet has made the world a
smaller place. Last week I joined <a href="http://jfdi.bz/">JFDI.bz</a>, a community for
solo-founders launching their own thing.</p>

<p>My goal for joining this community was to have access to other motivated
entrepreneurs that I could use as a sounding-board. I also figured it&rsquo;d be
great opportunity to peek in to other solo founders launch process and
motivation for a particular product.</p>

<h3>Week of Hustle</h3>

<p>Week of Hustle is an 8-day sprint to launch something. Anything really&hellip;could
be an existing product that you need to put the finishing touches on, or a
brand new idea. It was one of the things that attracted most to JFDI.</p>

<p>Launching any kind of product is time consuming. And with a family and other
full-time responsibilities, life can get in the way. I feel like I&rsquo;m pretty
good at managing my time efficiently, but when accountability is involved, it&rsquo;s
much harder to put it off.</p>

<h3>My Goal</h3>

<p>This week I will be launching a free <strong>5-day email course</strong> focused on
<strong>Building a Ruby Gem</strong>. My goal for the course is to build my newsletter
audience and work through the steps of building a smaller info product to
determine if there&rsquo;s enough interest in the subject to warrant writing an
ebook.</p>

<p>As part of 8-day process, I will be posting blog entries daily about my
progress and the challenges I&rsquo;m facing at each step. If you&rsquo;re interested in

<h3>Why an email course on Building a Ruby Gem?</h3>

<p>One of the first blog posts I wrote was about <a href="/blog/3-ways-to-get-started-contributing-to-open-source/">how to get started contributing
to Open Source</a>. I
wrote it because I remember being somewhat unsure about the topic early in my
Ruby career. Additionally, it garnered far more attention than any of my other
posts, which tells me there&rsquo;s clearly a need for this kind of discussion.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/ga.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics of my first few blog posts.&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>The Ruby gem ecosystem is really powerful, but equally confusing, in my
opinion. There are <em>strong</em> recommendations about how to structure the
internals of a gem, which can make writing your first gem pretty frustrating.</p>

<h3>My plan this week</h3>

<p>So getting down to business&hellip;here&rsquo;s my tentative plan this week:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Day 1 &ndash; Overall topic and organize what content goes on which days, setup GH
project and ready tags, write WOH day blog, why gem discussion (ref. open
source blog &ndash; pics of GA)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 2 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 3 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 4 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 5 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 6 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 7 &ndash;  Setup auto responder and way to capture for the course, write emails for each day of sequence</p></li>
<li><p>Day 8 &ndash; Launch with new landing page and notify subscribers</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Time Management</h3>

<p>I do have a full-time job and will be working all week. Because I try to spend
as much time as possible with my daughter, my goal is to accomplish the steps
above early in the AM. This morning I set my alarm for 6am, but got up 4:30am
because I was excited to start the week. Today was a relatively easy day in
terms of time-consuming tasks, so I&rsquo;m guessing I&rsquo;ll shoot for 5am the remainder
of the week. We&rsquo;ll see!</p>

<h3>Today&rsquo;s Accomplishments</h3>

<ul>
<li>I created a <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/so_meta_course">Github project to house the code I&rsquo;ll write</a></li>
<li>I wrote this post</li>
<li>I setup a mail chimp entry form for subscription to my WOH updates</li>
<li>I created the structure for the email course content</li>
<li>I searched through <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> and found a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/1qplmu/tutorial_build_a_gem_from_scratch/">few posts that
express</a>
a need to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/1qmb29/building_a_gem_from_scratch_google_hangout_today/">learn about about writing Ruby
gems</a>.
Those interested in these posts would be a great target audience.</li>
</ul>
