    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>JFDI</h3>

<p>Living outside a major metropolitan area has made it hard to surround myself
with other entrepreneurs. Fortunately, the internet has made the world a
smaller place. Last week I joined <a href="http://jfdi.bz/">JFDI.bz</a>, a community for
solo-founders launching their own thing.</p>

<p>My goal for joining this community was to have access to other motivated
entrepreneurs that I could use as a sounding-board. I also figured it&rsquo;d be
great opportunity to peek in to other solo founders launch process and
motivation for a particular product.</p>

<h3>Week of Hustle</h3>

<p>Week of Hustle is an 8-day sprint to launch something. Anything really&hellip;could
be an existing product that you need to put the finishing touches on, or a
brand new idea. It was one of the things that attracted most to JFDI.</p>

<p>Launching any kind of product is time consuming. And with a family and other
full-time responsibilities, life can get in the way. I feel like I&rsquo;m pretty
good at managing my time efficiently, but when accountability is involved, it&rsquo;s
much harder to put it off.</p>

<h3>My Goal</h3>

<p>This week I will be launching a free <strong>5-day email course</strong> focused on
<strong>Building a Ruby Gem</strong>. My goal for the course is to build my newsletter
audience and work through the steps of building a smaller info product to
determine if there&rsquo;s enough interest in the subject to warrant writing an
ebook.</p>

<p>As part of 8-day process, I will be posting blog entries daily about my
progress and the challenges I&rsquo;m facing at each step. If you&rsquo;re interested in
receiving these updates via email, subscribe here:</p>

<h3>Why an email course on Building a Ruby Gem?</h3>

<p>One of the first blog posts I wrote was about <a href="/blog/3-ways-to-get-started-contributing-to-open-source/">how to get started contributing
to Open Source</a>. I
wrote it because I remember being somewhat unsure about the topic early in my
Ruby career. Additionally, it garnered far more attention than any of my other
posts, which tells me there&rsquo;s clearly a need for this kind of discussion.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/ga.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics of my first few blog posts.&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>The Ruby gem ecosystem is really powerful, but equally confusing, in my
opinion. There are <em>strong</em> recommendations about how to structure the
internals of a gem, which can make writing your first gem pretty frustrating.</p>

<h3>My plan this week</h3>

<p>So getting down to business&hellip;here&rsquo;s my tentative plan this week:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Day 1 &ndash; Overall topic and organize what content goes on which days, setup GH
project and ready tags, write WOH day blog, why gem discussion (ref. open
source blog &ndash; pics of GA)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 2 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 3 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 4 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 5 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 6 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 7 &ndash;  Setup auto responder and way to capture for the course, write emails for each day of sequence</p></li>
<li><p>Day 8 &ndash; Launch with new landing page and notify subscribers</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Time Management</h3>

<p>I do have a full-time job and will be working all week. Because I try to spend
as much time as possible with my daughter, my goal is to accomplish the steps
above early in the AM. This morning I set my alarm for 6am, but got up 4:30am
because I was excited to start the week. Today was a relatively easy day in
terms of time-consuming tasks, so I&rsquo;m guessing I&rsquo;ll shoot for 5am the remainder
of the week. We&rsquo;ll see!</p>

<h3>Today&rsquo;s Accomplishments</h3>

<ul>
<li>I created a <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/so_meta_course">Github project to house the code I&rsquo;ll write</a></li>
<li>I wrote this post</li>
<li>I setup a mail chimp entry form for subscription to my WOH updates</li>
<li>I created the structure for the email course content</li>
<li>I searched through <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> and found a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/1qplmu/tutorial_build_a_gem_from_scratch/">few posts that
express</a>
a need to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/1qmb29/building_a_gem_from_scratch_google_hangout_today/">learn about about writing Ruby
gems</a>.
Those interested in these posts would be a great target audience.</li>
</ul>
