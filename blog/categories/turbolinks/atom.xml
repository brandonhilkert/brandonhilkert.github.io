    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to escape Javascript in a Rails application. From a tiny script to a full-on Javascript framework, websites are becoming more and more reliant on Javascript, whether we like it or not.</p>

<p>Several articles back, I documented <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/page-specific-javascript-in-rails/">how I handle page-specific Javascript in a Rails application</a>. My solution included a third-party jQuery plugin that did some magic on the <code>$(document).ready</code> function in combination with CSS style scoping to limit the functionality.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The plugin worked well for awhile, but with the advent of Turbolinks, the
solution felt less and less appropriate. I&rsquo;ve since settled on some techniques
to not only handle page-specific Javascript, but overall organization and structure of Javascript within a Rails application. I&rsquo;ve used it in a hand full of large applications over the past few months and it&rsquo;s held up incredibly well.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Using &ldquo;sprinkles&rdquo; of Javascript throughout a Rails application can get unwieldly fast if we&rsquo;re not consistent. What we ideally want is some techniques and guidelines that can keep the Javascript organized in our projects. <strong>We also don&rsquo;t want to have to disable Turbolinks to make our application work as we expect</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>Generally, javascript behavior can be boiled down to the following categories:</p>

<ol>
<li>Behavior that&rsquo;s &ldquo;always on&rdquo;</li>
<li>Behavior that&rsquo;s triggered from a user action</li>
</ol>


<p>But first, a few things to will help us stay organized&hellip;</p>

<h2>Class Scoping</h2>

<p>I still like to scope the body element of the layout(s) with the controller and action name:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;body class="&lt;%= controller_name %&gt; &lt;%= action_name %&gt;"&gt;
  &lt;%= yield %&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></p>

<p>This not only let&rsquo;s us control access to the DOM through jQuery if we need to, but also provides some top-level styling classes to allow us to easily add page-specific CSS.</p>

<p>In the case we&rsquo;re working on the proverbial blog posts application, the body tag ends up looking like:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;body class="posts index"&gt;
  &lt;%= yield %&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></p>

<p>This gives us the opportunity to scope CSS and Javascripts to all <code>posts</code>-related pages in the controller with the <code>.posts</code> class, or down to the specific page using a combination of both the controller and action: <code>.posts.index</code>.</p>

<h2>Default Application Manifest</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the default <code>app/assets/javascripts/application.js</code>:</p>

<p><code>
// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file.
//
// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.
//
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .
</code></p>

<p>I start by removing the line <code>//= require_tree .</code>. I do this because if you don&rsquo;t, the javascript files in the folder will be loaded in alphabetical order. As you&rsquo;ll see below, there&rsquo;s an initialization file that needs to be loaded before other Javascript. We&rsquo;ll also remove the comments from the top of the file to preserve space.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;re left with:</p>

<p><code>
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
</code></p>

<h2>Initialization</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by adding the file <code>app/assets/javascripts/init.coffee</code> with the following:</p>

<p>```
window.App ||= {}</p>

<p>App.init = &ndash;>
  $(&ldquo;a, span, i, div&rdquo;).tooltip()</p>

<p>$(document).on &ldquo;page:change&rdquo;, &ndash;>
  App.init()
```</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dig in to each pagef of this:</p>

<p><code>
window.App ||= {}
</code></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re creating the <code>App</code> object on window so the functionality added to the object is available throughout the application.</p>

<p>Next, we define an <code>init()</code> function on <code>App</code> to initialize common jQuery plugins and other Javascript libraries:</p>

<p><code>
App.init = -&gt;
  $("a, span, i, div").tooltip()
</code></p>

<p>The call to <code>$("a, span, i, div").tooltip()</code> initializes Bootstrap Tooltips. This is an example of the type of libraries that can/should be setup here. Obviously, if you&rsquo;re not using Bootstrap tooltips, you would haven&rsquo;t this here, but coupled with the next line, we&rsquo;ll see why this works.</p>

<p>As many have found out the hard way, <strong>when Turbolinks is enabled</strong> in a project, jQuery <code>$(document).ready</code> functions <strong>don&rsquo;t get fired from page to page</strong>. In order to call the <code>init()</code> function on each page transition, we&rsquo;ll hook in to the <code>page:change</code> event:</p>

<p><code>
$(document).on "page:change", -&gt;
  App.init()
</code>
<em>Note: the <code>page:change</code> transition is also triggered on the well known document ready event, so there&rsquo;s no need to add any special handling for first page load.</em></p>

<p>Lastly, we need to add <code>init.coffee</code> to the asset pipeline:</p>

<p><code>
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require init
</code></p>

<h2>&ldquo;Always On&rdquo; Javascript Functionality</h2>

<p>Now with the defaults out of the way, let&rsquo;s take a look at adding some behavior.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume one of our pages will show a Javascript graph of data. We&rsquo;ll start by adding a file with a name related to that responsibility.</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>app/assets/javascripts/app.chart.coffee</h1>

<p>class App.Chart
  constructor: (@el) &ndash;></p>

<pre><code># intialize some stuff
</code></pre>

<p>  render: &ndash;></p>

<pre><code># do some stuff
</code></pre>

<p>$(document).on &ldquo;page:change&rdquo;, &ndash;>
  chart = new App.Chart $(&ldquo;#chart&rdquo;)
  chart.render()</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>A few things to note here&hellip;</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>I created a class in the <code>App</code> namespace &mdash; the same we initialized in <code>app/assets/javascripts/init.coffee</code>. This gives us an isolated class that has a clear responsiblity. Like our Ruby, we want to do our best to keep its responsibilities to a minimium.</p>

<p>You might notice the file takes the form:</p>

<p>```
|
|
class definition
|
|</p>

<p>|
invocation
|
```</p>

<p>While this may seem obvious, it&rsquo;s an important point to keep in mind. I&rsquo;ve found it offers a predictable structure that allows me to open any coffeescript file that we&rsquo;ve written in the project and generally know where to look for what.</p>

<h3>Turbolinks-Proof</h3>

<p>We called this &ldquo;Always On&rdquo; functionality because, as you probably noticed, using the following event listener <code>$(document).on "page:change", -&gt;</code>, we know with Turbolinks, this gets triggered on every page transition.</p>

<h3>Add to Manifest</h3>

<p>Because we removed the <code>//= require_tree .</code> line in the default <code>application.js</code> manifest file, we&rsquo;ll have to add our chart file to be included in the asset pipeline (last line):</p>

<p><code>
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require init
//= require app.chart
</code></p>

<h3>Page-Specific Javascript</h3>

<p>Uh oh, so maybe we don&rsquo;t want the graph to show up on every page! In this case, we&rsquo;re looking for &ldquo;Always On&rdquo; functionality for specific pages <strong>ONLY</strong>.</p>

<p>We can limit the page pages certain functionality is loaded on by using the classes we added to the body of the layout. In this case, a small conditional to the invocation can prevent this being triggered on pages it shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>

<p><code>
$(document).on "page:change", -&gt;
  return unless $(".posts.index").length &gt; 0
  f = new App.Chart $("#chart")
  f.render()
</code></p>

<p>We added <code>return unless $(".posts.index").length &gt; 0</code> to make sure <code>App.Chart</code> never gets instantiated if we&rsquo;re on the <code>.posts.index</code> page. While this may seem verbose, I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s not very common to need page-specific functionality. There are probably plenty of libraries that do something similar, like <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/page-specific-javascript-in-rails/">the one I previously suggested</a>. <strong>However, to me, limiting javascript to a single page and very explicit when I read the code, it&rsquo;s almost never worth dragging in a separate plugin for this. YMMV.</strong></p>

<h2>User-Triggered Javascript</h2>

<p>This type of Javascript is exactly what you&rsquo;d think &mdash; Javascript invoked as a result of a user clicking or performing some type of action. You&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;I know how to do this, I&rsquo;ll just add a random file to the javascripts directory and throw in some jQuery&rdquo;. While this will functionally work just fine, I&rsquo;ve found that keeping the structure of these files similar will give you great piece of mind going forward.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;data-behavior&rdquo; Attribute</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume there&rsquo;s a link in the user&rsquo;s account that allows them to update their credit card. In this case, we have the following:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;%= link_to "Update Credit Card", "#", data: { behavior: "update-credit-card" } %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll probably notice the <code>data-behavior</code> tag being added to the link. This is the key we&rsquo;ll use to attach the Javascript behavior.</p>

<p>We could have added a unique class to the link:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;%= link_to "Update Credit Card", "#", class: "update-credit-card" %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>or, perhaps, even assign an ID:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;%= link_to "Update Credit Card", "#", id: "update-credit-card" %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Both of these techniques don&rsquo;t really indicate whether we added the <code>update-card-card</code> for the use of CSS styling, or to attach Javascript behavior. So in my applications, I leave classes for <strong>styling ONLY</strong>.</p>

<p>So now to the Javascript:</p>

<p>```
App.Billing =
  update: &ndash;></p>

<pre><code># do some stuff
</code></pre>

<p>$(document).on &ldquo;click&rdquo;, &ldquo;[data-behavior~=update-credit-card]&rdquo;, =>
  App.Billing.update()
```</p>

<p>We can use the selector <code>[data-behavior~=update-credit-card]</code> to latch on to the <code>data-behavior</code> tag we defined in the view. We use the <code>on</code> jQuery method to ensure that we&rsquo;re listening to this event whether the element&rsquo;s on the page or not. This is what allows us to load this Javascript when on other pages and have it still work when a user clicks through to the page with the actual link on it.</p>

<p>We could latch on to the <code>change</code> event, or whatever is appropriate to the element we&rsquo;re adding behavior.</p>

<h3>Add to Manifest</h3>

<p>Again, because Javascripts assets we add to <code>app/assets/javascripts</code> won&rsquo;t automatically be inserted in to the asset pipeline, we&rsquo;ll add <code>//= require app.billing</code> to the manifest file:</p>

<p><code>
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require init
//= require app.chart
//= require app.billing
</code></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Using the techniques above, we can keep the Javascript in our Rails applications organized and predictable. We can rest easy knowing the files will all generally look the same. There&rsquo;s not been any uses cases where this structure hasn&rsquo;t worked for me personally.</p>

<p>One thing that makes me feel good about this approach is there&rsquo;s no real magic or extra plugins. It&rsquo;s using all the tools we already have in a basic Rails application, which is one less thing to maintain and keep up to date. Less depedencies == less pain down the road.</p>
