<p>One of the simplest and most common application of background processing is sending emails outside of a web
request. And while background processing is pretty common, most existing Ruby background processing libraries require an additional process to execute these jobs, resulting in increased infrastructure costs.</p>

<p>At the time, I was working on an application hosted on Heroku, and the cost of an additional dyno ($35/month) wasn’t justified. The background jobs did very little more than send emails out of band. To me, the traditional solutions seemed like overkill. And with this, the idea of <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch">sucker_punch</a> was born&hellip;</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Ruby Background Processing Libraries</h2>

<p>Until I had heard of <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a>, <a href="https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job/tree/master">delayed_job</a> and <a href="https://github.com/resque/resque">Resque</a> were the standard options for processing background jobs in Ruby. I&rsquo;ve used both and believe each has a great use case.</p>

<p>In my experience, it&rsquo;s easiest to start with delayed_job if you need background processing in your application. If and when the DB becomes your bottleneck, it&rsquo;s time to move on. Redis is a dependency of both Resque and Sidekiq, which increases the complexity and infrastructure maintenance, however, with <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/?q=redis">Heroku&rsquo;s hosted Redis
Add-ons</a>, this dependency is much less of a pain.</p>

<h2>My work on Sidekiq</h2>

<p>I previously wrote about my my <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/3-ways-to-get-started-contributing-to-open-source/">open source contributions</a> and how I got started. I had spent the previous several
months contributing to Sidekiq and learning more about concurrency patterns in Ruby.</p>

<p>Sidekiq is multi-threaded, which is the reason a single Sidekiq process is <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Testimonials">more
efficient</a> than a library like Resque. Although, nothing in life is free &ndash; care must be taken to ensure your jobs are thread-safe. A helpful <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Best-Practices">guide to writing thread-safe code</a> can be found on the Sidekiq wiki.</p>

<h2>Use Case</h2>

<p>I was working on <a href="http://defriendnotifierapp.com/">Defriend Notifier</a> and needed to notify users via email when their Facebook friend list changed. Using Sidekiq or any of the alternatives mentioned above certainly would’ve worked. In fact, the application originally used Sidekiq and functioned perfectly. However, as time went on, I decided the extra cost of the worker wasn’t justified, especially given that the application didn’t produce any revenue outside of advertising (very little…).</p>

<p>At the time, the only background processing library that didn’t require an additional background process was
<a href="https://github.com/mperham/girl_friday">girl_friday</a>, also written by <a href="https://twitter.com/mperham">Mike
Perham</a>, author of Sidekiq. While this solution worked for awhile, I found the syntax to be slightly non-intuitive and it felt a little dirty to pass around a global variable within the application
to manage a single job queue. I also experienced some memory leaks on Heroku as a result of switching to
girl_friday, but to be fair, I didn&rsquo;t spend much time determining the root cause. <em>Disclaimer: It very likely could’ve been due to code that I wrote</em>.</p>

<h2>Enter Celluloid</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid">Celluloid</a> describes itself as an actor-based concurrent object
framework for Ruby. Celluloid is the guts behind Sidekiq and the reason why the multi-threaded Sidekiq code is so readable. Celluloid abstracts away the details of concurrency so your code doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about manually managing thread synchronization and object message queuing.</p>

<h2>Sucker Punch is born</h2>

<p>girl_friday was written several years ago — before Celluloid was created. Realizing the power of Celluloid,
I figured there was an opportunity for a new library that behaved like girl_friday, but utilized
Celluloid&rsquo;s more reliable multi-threading capabilities. And because Celluloid handles so much of the complexity, the gem itself would be relatively simple — really a DSL around enqueuing jobs to a <a href="https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/wiki/Pools">Celluloid Pool</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/brandonhilkert/status/292630123981729793">posed the question to Mike Perham</a> and he confirmed my suspicions.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/sucker-punch-tweet.png" title="&ldquo;Sucker Punch Tweet&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Fortunately, Celluloid had all of the functionality needed for background queues already built-in. While the
functionality was there, the usage syntax was awkward.</p>

<p>I spent the next few days creating a DSL around the Celluloid internals, thus making it feel more specific to
background queues.</p>

<p>Here’s the result of a typical job class:</p>

<pre><code>class LogJob
  include SuckerPunch::Job

  def perform(event)
    # do some other stuff to
    # record the event in the background
    puts "#{event} just happened"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I deployed my sucker_punch-converted application code to production and gave it a week or so before I declared it a success. Once I realized sucker_punch was going to be a maintainable method for processing background jobs in a single web process, I added additional niceties like logging and queue configuration details that may be valuable for other use cases.</p>

<p>Have you tried <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch">sucker_punch</a> yet? If so, I&rsquo;d love to know how it went and what you used it for&hellip;</p>

    <updated>2014-03-04T17:43:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/build-a-ruby-gem-technical-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Greetings from a now less snowy Eastern USA!</p>

<p>The past few weeks have seemed like one big snow storm. We haven’t had many days above freezing and spent very little time outside (voluntarily at least). I’m sure those living in colder climates are probably saying “cry me a river…” right now. On the bright side, our extended home stays have given me more time to write.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><img class="center" src="/images/snow.jpg" title="&ldquo;West Chester Snow&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Since the last time, I made some serious progress…</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The chapter list is finalized</strong> &ndash; I’m thankful for all the feedback you provided about the chapter list. It really helped me determine the more important topics and make sure they were well covered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content is done</strong> &ndash; Snow days inside will do that. I made a big push to strengthen the weaker areas where there was overwhelming interest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grammatical editing is done</strong> &ndash; I’m lucky to be surrounded by really supportive people that have both the skill and interest to help edit. They pitched in and we knocked it out!</p>

<p> <img class="center" src="/images/editing.jpg" title="&ldquo;Build a Ruby Gem Editing&rdquo;" ></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technical review is underway</strong> &ndash; Again, I can’t stress how lucky I feel that people I respect and look up to in the Ruby community volunteered their free time to review the book. I suspect it’ll be another week or 2 before the final changes are sorted out, but never the less, technical review is well underway.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.mikeperham.com/">Mike Perham</a> is writing a foreword</strong> &ndash; Mike is someone I greatly respect and helped me navigate the open source eco-system when I first started contributing to his <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a> project. He’s been contributing to OSS far longer than Sidekiq and the Ruby community is lucky to have him. He’s written a beautifully succinct opening for the book as it relates to developing open source software. If reading his foreword doesn’t motivate to start contributing, I don’t now what will.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Specifics about the launch date haven’t been determined, but <strong>the book will definitely launch in late March</strong>. I plan to be in touch with a <strong>sample chapter and coupon code</strong>, as promised, when the time gets closer.</p>

<p>Looking back on the items mentioned above, I’m really excited to be nearing the home stretch and finally get it in to your hands.</p>

<p>Hope you had a great past couple of weeks. Talk to you soon.</p>

    <link href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/understanding-the-rails-cache-id-environment-variable/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-19T07:19:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/understanding-the-rails-cache-id-environment-variable</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I was looking through my Twitter stream and came across a tweet that referenced <code>ENV[“RAILS_CACHE_ID”]</code>. I was unfamiliar with this environment variable and made a note to learn more.</p>

<p>Rails 4 has made a discernible effort to improve view rendering performance by what they’re calling <a href="http://signalvnoise.com/posts/3690-the-performance-impact-of-russian-doll-caching">russian doll caching</a>. Prior to this, view caching was simple in syntax, but realistically more complicated when cached partials needed busting on subsequent releases.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I didn’t know if this environmental variable had anything to do with Rails 4 caching, so I went digging…</p>

<p>The first thing I did was <code>git clone</code> the Rails source code and look for that variable. Outside of the documentation and tests, it showed up in one place, <code>activesupport/lib/active_support/cache.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code># Expands out the +key+ argument into a key that can be used for the
# cache store. Optionally accepts a namespace, and all keys will be
# scoped within that namespace.
#
# If the +key+ argument provided is an array, or responds to +to_a+, then
# each of elements in the array will be turned into parameters/keys and
# concatenated into a single key. For example:
#
#   expand_cache_key([:foo, :bar])               # =&gt; "foo/bar"
#   expand_cache_key([:foo, :bar], "namespace")  # =&gt; "namespace/foo/bar"
#
# The +key+ argument can also respond to +cache_key+ or +to_param+.

def expand_cache_key(key, namespace = nil)
  expanded_cache_key = namespace ? "#{namespace}/" : ""

  if prefix = ENV["RAILS_CACHE_ID"] || ENV["RAILS_APP_VERSION"]
    expanded_cache_key &lt;&lt; "#{prefix}/"
  end

  expanded_cache_key &lt;&lt; retrieve_cache_key(key)
  expanded_cache_key
end
</code></pre>

<p>The comments preceding the method do a good job telling the whole story. The <code>expanded_cache_key</code> variable is an array built up from the <code>key</code> argument. The <code>RAILS_CACHE_ID</code> environment variable is prefaced to this array, operating similar to a namespace.</p>

<p>With these assumptions in mind, let’s see if we prove for sure. I’ll generate a new Rails 4 app:</p>

<pre><code>$ rails new cache_test
</code></pre>

<p>We’ll be inspecting model objects, so let’s generate a fake blog model:</p>

<pre><code>$ rails g scaffold post title content:text
</code></pre>

<p>Migrate the database to get current:</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/rake db:migrate
</code></pre>

<p>I’ll create a new <code>Post</code> and take a look at the default <code>cache_key</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ rails c
&gt; p = Post.create
&gt; p.cache_key # =&gt; "posts/1-20140206201702645196000"
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s set the <code>RAILS_CACHE_ID</code> and look at the <code>cache_key</code> of this record again:</p>

<pre><code>$ export RAILS_CACHE_ID=octopus
$ rails c
&gt; p = Post.create
&gt; p.cache_key # =&gt; "posts/1-20140206201702645196000"
</code></pre>

<p>Hmmm…same thing. Referring back to the Rails course code above, it turns out that not all cache writes use the <code>expand_cache_key</code> method. Searching around the Rails code for <code>expand_cache_key</code>, we find the following results:</p>

<pre><code>ActionController::Caching::Fragments#fragment_cache_key
ActionDispatch::Http::Cache::Response#etag=
</code></pre>

<p>From the looks of it, it only applies to fragment caching and manually setting ETAG headers for HTTP responses, so let’s dig in to those.</p>

<h2>Fragment Caching</h2>

<p>I can cache the post fragment by wrapping it in a <code>cache</code> block:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% app/views/posts/show.html.erb %&gt;
&lt;%= cache(@post) do %&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;%= @post.title %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Content:&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;%= @post.content %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Run the server and make a request to <code>http://localhost:3000/posts/1</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Started GET "/posts/1" for 127.0.0.1 at 2014-02-06 16:16:04 -0500
  ActiveRecord::SchemaMigration Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "schema_migrations".* FROM "schema_migrations"

  Rendered posts/show.html.erb within layouts/application (11.0ms)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note: Make sure <code>config.action_controller.perform_caching</code> is set to <code>true</code> in <code>config/environments/development.rb</code> (it’s <code>false</code> by default), otherwise caching is disabled.</em></p>

<p>There it is! It wrote out the key <code>views/octopus/posts/1-20140206210721854446000/c39e6bde261c006ffe9ddf27fb9d5318</code>. Let’s change the environmental variable and see if it adjusts accordingly:</p>

<pre><code>$ export RAILS_CACHE_ID=shark
</code></pre>

<p>Restart the Rails server and again, request <code>http://localhost:3000/posts/1</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Started GET "/posts/1" for 127.0.0.1 at 2014-02-06 16:35:33 -0500
  ActiveRecord::SchemaMigration Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "schema_migrations".* FROM "schema_migrations"
Processing by PostsController#show as HTML
  Parameters: {"id"=&gt;"1"}
  Post Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."id" = ? LIMIT 1  [["id", "1"]]

Read fragment views/shark/posts/1-20140206210721854446000/c39e6bde261c006ffe9ddf27fb9d5318 (0.3ms)
Write fragment views/shark/posts/1-20140206210721854446000/c39e6bde261c006ffe9ddf27fb9d5318 (1.5ms)
  Rendered posts/show.html.erb within layouts/application (11.1ms)
Completed 200 OK in 82ms (Views: 62.7ms | ActiveRecord: 0.5ms)
</code></pre>

<p>Sure enough…the key <code>views/shark/posts/1-20140206210721854446000/c39e6bde261c006ffe9ddf27fb9d5318</code> was used this time.</p>

<h2>Etags</h2>

<p>Etags are a value added to the HTTP headers that allow a browser to determine whether the content for a particular piece of content should be refreshed or not. If not, the server returns a <code>304</code> HTTP code and the browser uses the cached response from a previous request.</p>

<p>Rails provides two controller helper methods to help determine whether the content should be refreshed: <code>fresh_when</code> and <code>stale?</code>. The <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#conditional-get-support">Rails guides</a> provide a decent explanation of these methods and when to use them.</p>

<p>Jumping in to the <code>PostsController</code>, let’s use the <code>fresh_when</code> method in the <code>show</code> action:</p>

<pre><code>class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController

  def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
    fresh_when(@post)
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when we request the <code>show</code> page for that post, we get an Etag back in the header response of <code>9c754ae292618570ec43cae8e03a0b13</code>. That doesn’t look very familiar, huh?</p>

<p>It turns out that the Etag is generated using the following method:</p>

<pre><code>Digest::MD5.hexadigest(key)
</code></pre>

<p>But the key is more than just the <code>cache_key</code> of the <code>@post</code>. If we refer back to where the <code>expand_cache_key</code> method was used, we see that when the <code>etag</code> attribute is set on the response, the key is expanded using the <code>ActiveSupport::Cache#expand_cache_key</code> method we looked at above:</p>

<pre><code> def etag=(etag)
   key = ActiveSupport::Cache.expand_cache_key(etag)
   @etag = self[ETAG] = %("#{Digest::MD5.hexdigest(key)}")
 end
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s stop the server and reset the <code>ENV[“RAILS_CACHE_ID”]</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ export RAILS_CACHE_ID=whale
</code></pre>

<p>Running the same request, we get an Etag of <code>b389da68ca1b25986edecf349fcf63e6</code>. So as you can see, by updating <code>ENV[“RAILS_CACHE_ID”]</code> alone, we get a different Etag in the response without changing the <code>post</code> object itself, which means we can invalidate our browser cache by updating this environmental variable.</p>

<p>I, personally, deploy to Heroku most of the time and it’d be nice to be able take advantage of browser caching in this manner, but also know when a new deploy is released. <a href="http://ninjasandrobots.com/rails-caching-a-problem-with-etags-and-a-solution">This article</a> describes a solution that integrates Heroku’s numbered releases.</p>

<p>However, we know that Heroku uses git to get the source code of the appellation to the application container, so why not leverage git commit IDs for <code>ENV[“RAILS_CACHE_ID”]</code>.</p>

<p><code>git log</code> is a command to look at….well, git logs!. With a few additional options, we can get a shortened version of the commit SHA:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --pretty=format:%h -n1
40ad584
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Combining the git commit SHA gives us the perfect opportunity to invalidate browser cache</strong>. If the Etag is different because a different git commit SHA is the most recent on the server, we know there’s a potential the HTML rendered and cached in the browser could be outdated. We can implement this by setting the ENV variable in <code>config/application.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ENV['RAILS_CACHE_ID'] = `git log --pretty=format:%h -n1`.strip
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when a request is made we get an Etag of <code>6d80b6397347f8de1b8718e7fd9f90e1</code>. And if we add an empty commit and re-request the post, we get an Etag of <code>6dcc66ddf83613dd0c46406a1e983b38</code>.</p>

<p>Hooray! <strong>A browser caching strategy for HTML content that’s dependent on the git release</strong>.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Before Rails 4, it was common to use a version number in the view <code>cache</code> method so that when you changed a encompassed view template, the cache would bust and the changes would be shown. However, now that <code>cache_digests</code> are part of Rails 4, the contents of the template block is evaluated and an MD5 string is created from the contents (the latter part of the cache key &ndash; <code>c39e6bde261c006ffe9ddf27fb9d5318</code> in the last example). This ensures that whenever the contents of the view template are changed, the cache is busted and the new template is properly stored and rendered.</p>

<p>Given the <code>cache_key</code> of fragment caching is dependent on the contents of the template, I have trouble finding value in setting the <code>RAILS_CACHE_ID</code> environmental variable for fragment caching alone.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the use case for using <code>ENV[“RAILS_CACHE_ID”]</code> to control browser caching can be a tremendous asset when the content of the body response is not considered. Caching strategies can be difficult to reason about and hopefully this gives you another tool in the toolbox to make parts of your Rails applications more performant.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago, I joined <a href="http://jfdi.bz/">JFDI.bz</a> &ndash; a community for
solo-founders launching their own thing. Once a month, the group engages in a
<em>Week of Hustle</em> &ndash; a week long sprint to launch something.
I chose to launch an email course on the topic of <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/courses/build-a-ruby-gem/?utm_source=bh-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=woh-summary">building a Ruby
gem</a>.</p>

<h2>Why <em>Build a Ruby Gem</em>?</h2>

<p>A few years ago, I was building my first Ruby gem and I was left pretty
confused with the process and conventions. After working through my
frustrations, I thought the information I learned could be useful to others.</p>

<p>Honestly, I thought to write an eBook at first, however, the last thing I
wanted was to invest a month or two of my time only to find out people
weren&rsquo;t interested.</p>

<p>An email course was a good medium &ndash; I could cover the basics well enough to get
people through their hangups, while also validating the need for an eBook. I
figured if I got <strong>100-200</strong> people to sign up for the course, I would move
forward with the book.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>It turns out my marketing efforts were more successful than I anticipated.</p>

<h3>Today, almost 600 people have taken the Build a Ruby Gem email course!</h3>

<h2>Email is King&hellip;still</h2>

<p>Prior to launching this email course, I&rsquo;d read about the value of building an
email list from people like <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/">Nathan Barry</a>, <a href="http://unicornfree.com/">Amy
Hoy</a> and <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/">Justin Jackson</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also read countless other posts describing the most common regrets when
launching a new product. Almost all of them included not building an email
list. With that said, it was one of the first things I setup.</p>

<p>I blogged each day about my progress. Each post had a
mailing list subscription form that sent them subsequent daily updates.  Subscriptions
were slow at first, but interest built.  By then end of the week <strong>232</strong> people had
subscribed. And the day the course went live, I was able to to convert <strong>115</strong>
(~50%) of them.</p>

<p>The people subscribed were <strong>EXACTLY</strong> my target audience so it&rsquo;s no surprise
conversion was high.</p>

<h2>Finding Your Target Audience</h2>

<p>Fortunately for me, my target audience was Ruby developers and they hang out
online (surprise, surprise). But where online&hellip;</p>

<p>Let me hit you with something that seems obvious in hindsight:</p>

<h3>Marketing is easy when you build a product for an audience you&rsquo;re already part of.</h3>

<p>This was something I&rsquo;d <a href="http://unicornfree.com/2013/how-do-you-create-a-product-people-want-to-buy">read over the past few
months</a>,
but not seen its value until now.</p>

<p>The email course is for <strong>Ruby developers</strong>, I&rsquo;m a <strong>Ruby Developer</strong>, so the
question becomes&hellip;.<em>where do I hang out online?</em></p>

<p>That question is <strong>easy</strong> to answer &ndash; <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby weekly</a>,
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby">Reddit</a> and
<a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/">RubyFlow</a>.</p>

<p>And don&rsquo;t you know&hellip;it turns out those 3 sources have been the highest
converting sources since the course launched:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ruby weekly &ndash; 131</li>
<li>RubyFlow &ndash; 65</li>
<li>Reddit &ndash; 62</li>
</ol>


<p>The remaining sources were a combination of direct links, social media and
other technology news aggregation sites (probably mostly stemming from the top
sources above).</p>

<p><em>Note: I&rsquo;ve been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/80-20-Sales-Marketing-Definitive/dp/1599185059">80/20 Sales and
Marketing</a>
and the numbers above coincide, almost exactly, to the 80/20 curve. That is,
80% of the conversion came from 20% of the sources.</em></p>

<h2>Twitter Tip</h2>

<p>The last day of the email course has a <em>Summary</em> section thanking people for
taking the course and attempting to get feedback. While I haven&rsquo;t received much
constructive criticism, I dropped this little doozie at the bottom:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/email-course/click-to-tweet.png" title="&ldquo;Build a Ruby Gem Email Course Click To Tweet&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d read a post about <a href="http://grinnick.com/posts/how-groove-s-email-copy-makes-their-posts-go-viral?ref=hn">GroveHQ&rsquo;s emails going
viral</a>
and this was something they did in their campaigns.</p>

<p>The link allows people to click and immediately be setup to Tweet the
following:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/email-course/course-tweet.png" title="&ldquo;Build a Ruby Gem Email Course Tweet&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to determine the value of those tweets, but over 10 people have
clicked and tweeted. To me, this was surprising, but valuable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll probably look to make it stand out a bit more to hopefully improve the
click-through.</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>I spent a total of <strong>16 hours</strong> creating the <em>Build a Ruby Gem</em> email
course, which has since <strong>validated the need for a book</strong>. While interest
in a free email course doesn&rsquo;t guarantee a book on the same subject will sell, it was
the closet thing I could think to do outside of taking pre-orders.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started writing the <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/books/build-a-ruby-gem/?utm_source=bh-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=woh-summary"><em>Build a Ruby Gem</em>
book</a>.
