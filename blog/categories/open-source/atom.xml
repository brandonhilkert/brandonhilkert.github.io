<p>I let myself sleep in until 5:30am this morning ;) I spent a few very
unsuccessful hours wrestling with Wordpress last night and didn&rsquo;t get to bed at
the time I wanted. However, all is well. I was able to push out Day 4 of the
Build a Ruby Gem Email Course without issue.</p>

<p>One of the things that I&rsquo;m noticing about putting the course posts together is
how much the content relies on outside resources. Whether it&rsquo;s an external URL,
the output of a command prompt, or a diff on Github&hellip;getting those together is
a non-trivial amount of time.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>A side effect of getting up early is that by 7:30am (when I&rsquo;ve typically finish
this post), I feel really productive. At this point, I&rsquo;ve worked for 2 straight
hours, all of which have been highly focused. So at 7:30am, I take a break, get
some breakfast and take a shower and &ldquo;start&rdquo; the rest of my day. It feels like
the day starts out on a better foot as a result.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also found that I&rsquo;ve been able to focus better early in the morning vs.
later at night. I know this is personal thing, some people do their best work
in the wee hours of the night. Not me, I&rsquo;m a morning person and have embraced
it. My productivity in the morning is probably 2-3x that of my normal
productivity during the day. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m refreshed or
fewer distractions (it&rsquo;s dark, no TV, no social media, no other windows
open&hellip;).</p>

<h3>What I Accomplished Today</h3>

<p>I pushed out the latest day of the email course. I feel like it&rsquo;s just starting
to get in to the thick of things. I&rsquo;ve been really sensitive to the fact that
not every person that takes the course will be a Ruby veteran. Hopefully the
detailed discussions on load paths and basic installations won&rsquo;t detract from
the value for those that are.</p>

<p>Yesterday I mentioned the non-optimal formatting of my email campaigns on
mobile devices. I spent some time with Mailchimp last night and applied a more
responsive template to the campaign. It&rsquo;s better, but still somewhat finicky in
the iOS Gmail app. I&rsquo;ve sent a support request and hopefully I&rsquo;ll have that
ironed out soon. But for those on every other platform, you should&rsquo;ve had a
much better reading experience!</p>

<h3>Marketing</h3>

<p>As I expected, the growth of both the mailing list and page views slowed down a bit.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/ga-day3.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics day 3 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>I got a 15% bump in mailing list subscriptions, which is better than nothing!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/mailchimp-day3.png" title="&ldquo;Mailchimp day 3 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sending the daily update campaigns at 8pm. I didn&rsquo;t put much thought in to
this time, other than the fact that I stumbled on an email marketing post that
suggested the hours between 8-12am get the best open rates. According to the
campaign report, the open rate is doing well, as compared with the average.
However, I have a tendency to believe it&rsquo;s more due to the nature of the
opted-in target audience. This is a very specific topic that people
specifically wanted to read about. So it makes sense to me that the open rate
would be pretty high.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/campaign-day3.png" title="&ldquo;Mailchimp day 3 campaign report&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Reddit continues to be a positive source of traffic. I had haphazardly posted
to Reddit in the past, but it&rsquo;s been driving more traffic than any other
source. Along with views, it&rsquo;s also yielded one of the highest conversion rates
for the mailing list. So I&rsquo;ll continue to post my updates there.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/sources-day3.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics day 3 traffic sources&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Until tomorrow&hellip;</p>

<h3>Back at it</h3>

<p>I hit the 5:00am goal this morning! It&rsquo;s 6:15am and I&rsquo;ve wrapped up the 2nd day of
the Build a Ruby Gem Email Course.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I had some anxiety about the amount of writing involved in putting
this course together. I&rsquo;ve read a number of blog posts about building a Ruby
gem, but most seem to assume you have a pretty in depth knowledge of creating
gems, while others skip important details of the process. So I knew going in to
it that I wanted to write about it a little differently. I wanted to talk more
about theory of why things are being done vs. how the Ruby language works.</p>

<p>Thinking back to my first Ruby gem, I remember my frustration trying to
understand the conventions of naming and file structure. So I&rsquo;m writing the course I
wish I had when I started.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Flow</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s been 3 days since I started documenting this process and the writing
process has gotten significantly easier. Since I started my blog, I&rsquo;ve read a
number of posts recommending the value of writing every day, regardless of the
subject. I&rsquo;m beginning to see the benefit of this consistency. I&rsquo;ll report back
on this by the end of the week as it should be even more apparent by then.</p>

<h3>What I Accomplished today</h3>

<p>I wrote Day 2 of the Build a Ruby Gem Email Course. The content organization
that I did on the first day has proved to be valuable. Outside of moving a few
topics around, it&rsquo;s stayed largely in tact. So here&rsquo;s to organization!!!</p>

<p>I think I also solved my email list problems. Actually, it was less &ldquo;problems&rdquo;, and
more, I need to learn how to use <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a>. I was in touch with their support
over an issue around signing up for multiple lists. I originally had the
subscriptions to the Week of Hustle updates going to my personal newsletter
list. This caused a semi-alarming error message if you were already on the
list.</p>

<p>The solution was to create a separate list and manage it outside of the realm
of my newsletter. Despite seeming over-complicated at first, I now feel
comfortable with this solution and I think it actually fits my goals better.
I&rsquo;ve already started to think of the best way to manage the email course once
it&rsquo;s live.</p>

<h3>What I&rsquo;m working on today</h3>

<p>A few people have pointed out some oddities with the formatting of my email
updates and there are a few design changes I&rsquo;d like to make on the sign up
forms. However, because the email updates are going out daily, it&rsquo;s my first
priority.</p>

<p>There have been no changes to the timeline I posted yesterday, and still feel
like I&rsquo;m on schedule to finish by the end of the weekend!</p>

<h3>Marketing</h3>

<p>I was originally worried that the buzz surrounding the course and my updates
about the process would die off and I&rsquo;d get another couple people throughout
the week. This appears to not be the case. However, I&rsquo;m not convinced it&rsquo;ll
continue this way throughout the week.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/ga-day2.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics day 2 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>As you can see, traffic to the blog was almost exactly the same as the previous
day (Sunday).</p>

<p>I screwed up the Google Analytics tracking code on the layouts, so I wasn&rsquo;t
tracking email list conversions until late last night. But the good news is
that according to Mailchimp, I signed up another 25 subscribers to the updates list.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/mailchimp-day2.png" title="&ldquo;Mailchimp day 2 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>This is down from the previous day, but overall, I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. I did
get a little boost because I sent a campaign about the course and my updates to
my newsletter email list, which seemed to account for maybe 8-10 subscriptions.</p>

<p>See you tomorrow!</p>

</p>

<p>Alright, back at it! I didn&rsquo;t quite hit the
5:00am goal I had, but was early enough to accomplish
what I was shooting for. (Setting my alarm for
11:58pm because namecheap.com had hourly Cyber Monday
coupon codes didn&rsquo;t help&hellip;).</p>

<h3>What I Accomplished today</h3>

<p>Today I wrote the first post out of 5 and it went
relatively smooth. Yesterday I created a rough outline
for the course content using
<a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>. I&rsquo;ve used it mainly as
a place to spew out the ideas that are not necessarily
organized, but just general notes about things I want to
make sure get covered (imagine that, using Evernote for
notes?!?!).</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Writing my entry for the email course caused me to
realize that I had to make a few changes to my blog to
facilitate the course (ie. hide newsletter signup at the
end of each course). Those changes probably took 10-15
min. However, I got them out of the way so I won&rsquo;t have
to worry about it anymore for future courses (I know, fat
chance a web developer leaves something alone for very
long&hellip;).</p>

<h3>What I&rsquo;m working on</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s been some weirdness with my Mailchimp sign up
form, mostly around signing up for multiple groups as an
existing recipient. I&rsquo;ve submitted a support request and
have been reaching out to people that are far more
knowledgable than I using email lists and hope to have it
resolved by the end of the day, at which point I&rsquo;ll notify my existing
email list of the course.</p>

<h3>My new timeline</h3>

<p>I made a few changes/additions to my project timeline as
you can see below:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><del>Day 1 &ndash; Overall topic and organize what content goes on which days, setup GH
project and ready tags, write WOH day blog, why gem discussion (ref. open
source blog &ndash; pics of GA)</del></p></li>
<li><p><del>Day 2 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</del></p></li>
<li><p>Day 3 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 4 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 5 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 6 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 7 &ndash;  Setup auto responder and way to capture for the course, write emails for each day of sequence (depending on the content). Proofread all course posts.</p></li>
<li><p>Day 8 &ndash; Launch with new landing page and notify subscribers</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I realized I needed to separate out time to proofread previous email course
content posts. After writing for over an hour, I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m in the
best position to be critical of my writing. I think editing after the fact will
also reveal some places where content can be removed due to wordiness.</p>

<h3>Marketing</h3>

<p>I wanted to add a marketing section to each of these updates because building
an audience is such a critical piece of this process. Yesterday, I posted my
<a href="/blog/build-a-ruby-gem-woh-day-1/">Day 1</a> post around the internet and got
overwhelmingly positive feedback.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;sign up for updates&rdquo; form yielded around 40 subscriptions. My wife and I
went to the movies yesterday and at one point I looked at my phone and saw
this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/mailbox.png" title="&ldquo;My mailbox showing Mailchimp subscriptions&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Yesterday I mentioned part of my motivation for launching this <strong>Build a Ruby
Gem</strong> email course was to determine if there was enough interest in the topic
to warrant an ebook. So far, so good&hellip;</p>

<p>Total visits to the site was 337. I&rsquo;ll take a 10% conversion rate any day!</p>

<h3>JFDI</h3>

<p>Living outside a major metropolitan area has made it hard to surround myself
with other entrepreneurs. Fortunately, the internet has made the world a
smaller place. Last week I joined <a href="http://jfdi.bz/">JFDI.bz</a>, a community for
solo-founders launching their own thing.</p>

<p>My goal for joining this community was to have access to other motivated
entrepreneurs that I could use as a sounding-board. I also figured it&rsquo;d be
great opportunity to peek in to other solo founders launch process and
motivation for a particular product.</p>

<h3>Week of Hustle</h3>

<p>Week of Hustle is an 8-day sprint to launch something. Anything really&hellip;could
be an existing product that you need to put the finishing touches on, or a
brand new idea. It was one of the things that attracted most to JFDI.</p>

<p>Launching any kind of product is time consuming. And with a family and other
full-time responsibilities, life can get in the way. I feel like I&rsquo;m pretty
good at managing my time efficiently, but when accountability is involved, it&rsquo;s
much harder to put it off.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>My Goal</h3>

<p>This week I will be launching a free <strong>5-day email course</strong> focused on
<strong>Building a Ruby Gem</strong>. My goal for the course is to build my newsletter
audience and work through the steps of building a smaller info product to
determine if there&rsquo;s enough interest in the subject to warrant writing an
ebook.</p>

<p>As part of 8-day process, I will be posting blog entries daily about my
progress and the challenges I&rsquo;m facing at each step. If you&rsquo;re interested in

<h3>Why an email course on Building a Ruby Gem?</h3>

<p>One of the first blog posts I wrote was about <a href="/blog/3-ways-to-get-started-contributing-to-open-source/">how to get started contributing
to Open Source</a>. I
wrote it because I remember being somewhat unsure about the topic early in my
Ruby career. Additionally, it garnered far more attention than any of my other
posts, which tells me there&rsquo;s clearly a need for this kind of discussion.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/ga.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics of my first few blog posts.&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>The Ruby gem ecosystem is really powerful, but equally confusing, in my
opinion. There are <em>strong</em> recommendations about how to structure the
internals of a gem, which can make writing your first gem pretty frustrating.</p>

<h3>My plan this week</h3>

<p>So getting down to business&hellip;here&rsquo;s my tentative plan this week:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Day 1 &ndash; Overall topic and organize what content goes on which days, setup GH
project and ready tags, write WOH day blog, why gem discussion (ref. open
source blog &ndash; pics of GA)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 2 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 3 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 4 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 5 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 6 &ndash; Write content and WOH blog (notify subscribers)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 7 &ndash;  Setup auto responder and way to capture for the course, write emails for each day of sequence</p></li>
<li><p>Day 8 &ndash; Launch with new landing page and notify subscribers</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Time Management</h3>

<p>I do have a full-time job and will be working all week. Because I try to spend
as much time as possible with my daughter, my goal is to accomplish the steps
above early in the AM. This morning I set my alarm for 6am, but got up 4:30am
because I was excited to start the week. Today was a relatively easy day in
terms of time-consuming tasks, so I&rsquo;m guessing I&rsquo;ll shoot for 5am the remainder
of the week. We&rsquo;ll see!</p>

<h3>Today&rsquo;s Accomplishments</h3>

<ul>
<li>I created a <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/so_meta_course">Github project to house the code I&rsquo;ll write</a></li>
<li>I wrote this post</li>
<li>I setup a mail chimp entry form for subscription to my WOH updates</li>
<li>I created the structure for the email course content</li>
<li>I searched through <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> and found a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/1qplmu/tutorial_build_a_gem_from_scratch/">few posts that
express</a>
a need to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/1qmb29/building_a_gem_from_scratch_google_hangout_today/">learn about about writing Ruby
gems</a>.
Those interested in these posts would be a great target audience.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Towards the end of 2012, I began feeling like a had a good grip on the Ruby
language. As mentioned in a <a href="/blog/the-technology-hump/">previous
post</a>, I felt confident enough in my skills that
I could make a positive contribution to the open source community.</p>

<p>I learned a lot by watching certain projects and getting involved with others
and hope that my notes are helpful for you and your endeavors.</p>

<h3>1. Fix a bug in an existing gem because it affects you</h3>

<p>My experience with <a href="/about">Meeteor</a> and <a href="/about">Spokely</a> caused me to move
FAST and break a lot of things along the way. Because of the pace, when I did
find a bug, I wasn&rsquo;t great at contributing code back to the source repository.
In many cases, my fixes were brute force <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey
patches</a> or something else that I
would probably be pretty embarassed about today.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Some of the more extreme cases caused me to <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/jquery-tokeninput">fork a
gem</a> and <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/jquery-tokeninput/commits/master">commit
changes</a> to
my version of the repo and reference my version of them gem in the application.
Thinking back on this now, doing so probably did more harm than good. The
downside is that it creates yet another fork of the gem and it also suffers
from lack of future updates by the original author. Unless, of course, you&rsquo;re
diligent about merging in changes from master, but let&rsquo;s admit, this never
happens.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I should have spent the extra 30 minutes to write organized and
tested code in order to contribute back to the original project. If I
experienced the bug, it&rsquo;s likely that others would too, if they hadn&rsquo;t already.</p>

<p><em>Be sure to review the Github issues for other reports of the bug.
It&rsquo;s possible there may already be an open pull request, thus
saving you the effort of preparing the fix.</em></p>

<h3>2. Improve an existing gem to learn more about the subject</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s best to head towards projects that you either have passion for or use
heavily.  If you&rsquo;re unsure of the level of effort required for an issue or
feature, ask the gem&rsquo;s author. Also, before you prepare that killer feature
that&rsquo;s going to take you 2 weeks to prepare, make sure it&rsquo;s known and approved
by the auther. It&rsquo;s a bummer to put in all that work only to learn that it&rsquo;s
not something the author is interested in adding and supporting. They&rsquo;ll likely
be happy for the extra help and point you in the right direction.</p>

<p>For me, this was <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a>. I had been a long time user of
<a href="https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job">Delayed Job</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/resque/resque">Resque</a>. When I first tried Sidekiq, I was
dumbfounded at how much faster it was because of its multi-threading
capabilities. I was also really surprised how easy it was to get started.
Sidekiq&rsquo;s author, <a href="https://twitter.com/mperham">Mike Perham</a>, has done a great job at
keeping the API similar to that of Resque, thus minimizing the pain of
switching.</p>

<p>Often, a popular gem will have a list of pending features to be written for
upcoming versions. If you can&rsquo;t find this list documented in the source code,
again, ask the gem&rsquo;s contributors. They&rsquo;ll likely have thought through upcoming
features and can make recommendations on how to get started.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no better way to learn than reading code. Sidekiq uses
Celluloid to handle the concurrency and for me, concurrency was an
afterthought. I realized this and figured by contributing, it would force me to
better understand the fundamental patterns of concurrency in Ruby.</p>

<p>I can hear the next question&hellip;how can you contribute to a codebase you want to
learn about but know nothing about?  At the time, Sidekiq&rsquo;s Web UI wasn&rsquo;t
great. Web applications are what I&rsquo;m good at, so I took it as an opportunity to
improve the Sidekiq Web UI, while I became more familiar with Sidekiq&rsquo;s
internals. I spent a few weeks <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/contributors">playing with graphs and improving Sidekiq&rsquo;s
internal API</a> and was able to
make the Web UI significantly better than it was before I started.</p>

<p>That was the start of my contribution to Sidekiq and since then have learned
quite a bit more about what makes the system tick. It&rsquo;s by no means a straight
forward gem and probably one I wouldn&rsquo;t urge you to cut your teeth on, but
certainly a challenge and very well maintained.</p>

<h3>3. Create a new gem by extracting code that you commonly use</h3>

<p>Greenfielding Rails apps is exciting. It starts out as <code>rails new
my-awesome-new-app</code>. You boot the server only to be greeted by the default
index page. The next steps are a series of copying and pasting from previous
applications or blog posts on the subject of configuring a Rails app. Whichever
<a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/rails-has-two-default-stacks">stack</a> you prefer,
there&rsquo;s generally a number of changes/additions that need to be made to kickstart the productivity.</p>

<p>Rather than paste in the same old code to handle &ldquo;______&rdquo; (insert your
favoritie super important feature), what better than to simply include a gem
that does it all for you. And what better person to create this gem than YOU!</p>

<p>On a previous project, I found myself calling the same view helper methods over
and over again, so I pulled it out into a
<a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/so_meta">gem</a> so I didn&rsquo;t have to worry
about copying the code across projects. It&rsquo;s a trivial example, but one that
can save you a lot of time and headache.</p>

<p>The ease of creating a gem is both a blessing and a curse for the community.
Ruby advocates writing code in a way that&rsquo;s modular, which tends to make
extracting that code to a gem pretty easy when done correctly. With a little
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+make+a+ruby+gem&amp;oq=how+to+make+a+ruby+gem">Google'ing</a>,
you can pretty quickly extract a feature that&rsquo;s already written and have it up
on RubyGems for the world to consume in no time.</p>

<h3>In summary</h3>

<p>I spent a fair amount of time trying to plot my entrace in to the Open Source
community. <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> has made it tremendously easy to not
only collaborate, but scour other products in search of code that might be
interesting to both learn and contribute to.</p>

<p>For those that write Ruby, I would urge you to avoid starting by contributing
to gems like Rails or other large codebases. Despite having plenty of work to
do, they&rsquo;re often hard to navigate and have quite a few idosyncrasies due to
their long and complex histories. It&rsquo;s also hard to know whether other people
are working on the same issue you might think is relatively trivial. There&rsquo;s
not much worse than putting in a few hard hours on a bug, only to have a pull
request fixing the same buy show up a few minutes before.</p>

<p>Start with a smaller project and figure out the path that works best for you.
Everyone is different, but that&rsquo;s what makes you so valuable to the open source
community. Work on things you love and make open source software better than
when you started.</p>

<p>What will your next open source project be?</p>
