    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sucker Punch was created because I had a <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/why-i-wrote-the-sucker-punch-gem/">need for background processing without a separate worker</a>. But I also figured others did too, given that adding a worker dyno on Heroku was $35. For hobby apps, this was a significant cost.</p>

<p>Having gotten familiar with Celluloid from my work on Sidekiq, I knew Celluloid had all the pieces to puzzle to make this easier. In fact, one of the earliest incarnations of Sucker Punch wasn&rsquo;t a gem at all, just some Ruby classes implementing the pieces of Celluloid necessary to put together a background processing queue.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The resulting code was less than ideal. It worked, but didn&rsquo;t feel like an API that anyone would want to use. From a beginner&rsquo;s perspective, this would stop adoption in its tracks. This is a common challenge with any code we encounter. No doubt, the Ruby standard library has all the tools necessary to make just about anything we can dream of, but sometimes the result isn&rsquo;t ideal. It&rsquo;s the same reason libraries like Rspec and HTTParty can exist. Developers prefer to use simplistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSLs</a> over convoluted, similarly-functioning code. Ruby has always been a language where developers consistently tout their ability to write code that reads well, feeding the levels of developer happiness.</p>

<h2>Why Rewrite Sucker Punch</h2>

<p>It started when <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch/issues/122">a version of Celluloid was yanked from RubyGems.org</a>. This resulted in a flurry of tweets and GH issues detailing their inability to bundle their applications.</p>

<p>As of version <code>0.17</code>, methods in public API changed without supporting documentation. On top of that, the core <code>celluloid</code> gem was split in to a series of child gems causing navigation to be painful.</p>

<p>This made my life as the Sucker Punch maintainer difficult. There were some requests to upgrade Sucker Punch to use Celluloid <code>~&gt; 0.17</code> and I feared of what would happen if I did. This caused me to think about what the future of Sucker Punch looked like without Celluloid. I still use Sucker Punch and believe it&rsquo;s a valuable asset to the community. My goal was to find a way to move it forward productively without experiencing similar pains.</p>

<p>In the end, thanks to some <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch/pull/126">communinity contributions</a>, <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch/blob/master/CHANGES.md#160">Sucker Punch <code>1.6.0</code> was released with Celluloid <code>0.17.2</code> support</a>.</p>

<h2>Where to now?</h2>

<p>Around that same time, Mike Perham had been writing about his experiences <a href="http://www.mikeperham.com/2015/10/14/optimizing-sidekiq/">optimizing Sidekiq</a> and <a href="http://www.mikeperham.com/2015/10/14/should-you-use-celluloid/">whether continuing with Celluloid made sense for Sidekiq</a>. Having less experience with multi-threading, it didn&rsquo;t make sense for me to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>I had been hearing about <a href="https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby`"><code>concurrent-ruby</code></a> through a variety of outlets, one of which was Rails <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/20866">replacing the existing concurrency latch with similar functionality from <code>concurrent-ruby</code></a>. After poking around <code>concurrent-ruby</code>, I realized it had all the tools necessary to build a background job processing library. Much like Celluloid in that respect, had the tools, but lacked the simple DSL for the use case.</p>

<p>What if Sucker Punch used <code>concurrent-ruby</code> in place of <code>celluloid</code>?</p>

<p>I can hear what you&rsquo;re thinking&hellip;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference? You&rsquo;re swapping one dependency for another!&rdquo;. 100% true. The difference was that the little bit of communication I had with the maintainers of <code>concurrent-ruby</code> felt comfortable, easy, and welcoming. And with <code>concurrent-ruby</code> now a dependency of Rails, it&rsquo;s even more accessible for those using Sucker Punch within a Rails application (a common use case). But like before, there&rsquo;s no way to be sure that  <code>concurrent-ruby</code> won&rsquo;t cause similar pains/frustrations.</p>

<h2>Celluloid Basics</h2>

<p>A basic Sucker Punch job looks like:</p>

<p>```
class LogJob
  include SuckerPunch::Job</p>

<p>  def perform(event)</p>

<pre><code>Log.new(event).track
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>To run the job asynchronously, we use the following syntax:</p>

<p><code>
LogJob.new.async.perform("new_user")
</code></p>

<p>The most interesting part of this method chain is the <code>async</code>. Removing <code>async</code>, leaves us with a call to a regular instance method.</p>

<p>It so happens that <a href="https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/wiki/Basic-usage"><code>async</code> is a method in Celluloid that causes the next method to execute asynchronously</a>. And this works because by including <code>SuckerPunch::Job</code>, we&rsquo;re including <code>Celluloid</code>, which gives us the <code>async</code> method on instances of the job class.</p>

<h2>Developing APIs</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with the basics of Celluloid, you&rsquo;ll notice there&rsquo;s not much to Sucker Punch. It adds the Celluloid functionality to job classes and does some things under the hood to ensure there&rsquo;s one queue for each job class.</p>

<p><strong>Early in my <code>concurrent-ruby</code> spike, I realized what a mistake to tie Sucker Punch&rsquo;s API to the API of Celluloid</strong>. Tinkering with the idea of removing Celluloid has left Sucker Punch with two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Continue using the <code>async</code> method with the new dependency</li>
<li>Break the existing DSL and create a dependency-independent syntax and try my best to document and support the change through the backwards-incompatible change</li>
</ol>


<p>Option 1 is the easy way out. Option 2 is more work, far more scary, but the right thing to do.</p>

<p>I decided to abandon my thoughts about previous versions and write as if it were new today. This will be the basis for the next major release of Sucker Punch (<code>2.0.0</code>).</p>

<p>Settling on abandoning the existing API, the next question is, <strong>&ldquo;What should the new API look like?&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<p>Being a fan of Sidekiq, it didn&rsquo;t take long for me to realize it could actually make developers lives easier if Sucker Punch&rsquo;s API was the same.</p>

<p>Switching between Sidekiq and Sucker Punch is not uncommon. I look at Sidekiq as Sucker Punch&rsquo;s big brother and often suggest people use it instead when the use case makes sense.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with Sidekiq, using the <code>perform_async</code> class method should look familiar:</p>

<p><code>
LogJob.peform_async("new_user")
</code></p>

<p><strong>So why not use the same for Sucker Punch?</strong></p>

<p>If so, switching between Sidekiq and Sucker Punch would be no more than swapping <code>include Sidekiq::Worker</code> for <code>include SuckerPunch::Job</code> in the job class, aside from the gem installation itself. The result would be less context switching and more opportunity focus on the important parts of the application.</p>

<p>I can hear the same question again, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference? You suggested isolating yourself from a dependency&rsquo;s API and now you&rsquo;re suggesting using another!&rdquo;. I look at this one a little differently&hellip;</p>

<p>Sidekiq is uniquely positioned in the community as a paid open source project. We&rsquo;re happy users of Sidekiq Pro and continue to do so for the support. You can certainly get support for the open source version, but one way to ensure Sidekiq is actively maintained is by paying for it. This financial support from us and others decreases the likelihood Mike will choose to abandon it. Mike&rsquo;s also been public about his long-term interest in maintaining Sidekiq. With all this in mind, I&rsquo;m willing to bank on its existence as the defacto way to enqueue jobs for background processing.</p>

<p>And if for some reason Sidekiq does disappear, there&rsquo;s nothing lost on Sucker Punch. There&rsquo;s no dependency. Just a similar syntax.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch <code>2.0.0</code> will have 2 class methods to enqueue jobs:</p>

<p><code>
LogJob.perform_async("new_user")
</code></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><code>
LogJob.perform_in(5.minutes, "new_user")
</code></p>

<p>The latter defining a delayed processing of the <code>perform</code> method 5 minutes from now.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Settling on a library&rsquo;s API isn&rsquo;t easy. Isolating it from underlying dependencies is the best bet for long-term stability. Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter">adapter pattern</a> can help create a layer (adapter) between your code and the dependency&rsquo;s API. But like always, there are always exceptions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m taking a leap of faith that doing what I believe is right won&rsquo;t leave existing users frustrated, ultimately abandoning Sucker Punch altogether.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch <code>v2.0</code> is shaping up to be the best release yet. I&rsquo;m looking forward to sharing it with you.</p>

    <link href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/sidekiq-as-a-microservice-message-queue/"/>
    <updated>2015-11-30T12:06:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/sidekiq-as-a-microservice-message-queue</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the recent series on transitioning to microservices, I detailed a path to move a large legacy Rails monolith to a cluster of a dozen microservices. But not everyone starts out with a legacy monolith. In fact, given Rails popularity amongst startups, <strong>it&rsquo;s likely most Rails applications don&rsquo;t live to see 4+ years in production</strong>. So what if we don&rsquo;t have a huge monolith on our hands? Are microservices still out of the question?</p>

<p>Sadly, the answer is, &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;. The &ldquo;depends&rdquo; part is specific to your context. While microservices may seem like the right move for you and your application, it&rsquo;s also possible it could cause a mess if not done carefully.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>This post will explore opportunities for splitting out unique microservices using <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a>, without introducing an enterprise message broker like <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> or <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>.</p>

<h2>When are Microservices right?</h2>

<p>Martin Fowler <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html">wrote about trade-offs that come when introducing microservices</a>.</p>

<p>The article outlines 6 pros and cons introduced when you moved a microservices-based architecture. The strongest argument for microservices is the strengthening of module boundaries.</p>

<p>Module boundaries are naturally strengthened when we&rsquo;re forced to move code to another codebase. The result being, in most cases a group of microservices appears to be better constructed than the legacy monolith it was extracted from.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt Rails allows developers to get something up and running very quickly. Sadly, you can do so while making a big mess at the same time. It&rsquo;s worth noting there&rsquo;s nothing stopping a monolith from being well constructed. With some discipline, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJVTM7mE1Cc">your monolith can be the bright and shiny beauty that DHH wants it to be</a>.</p>

<h2>Sidekiq Queues</h2>

<p>Ok, ok. You get it. Microservices can be awesome, but they can also make a big mess. I want to tell you about how I recently avoided a big mess without going &ldquo;all in&rdquo;.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no hiding I&rsquo;m a huge <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a> fan. It&rsquo;s my goto solution for background processing.</p>

<p>Sidekiq has the notion of <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Advanced-Options#workers">named queues</a> for both <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Advanced-Options#workers">jobs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Advanced-Options#queues">workers</a>. This is great from the standpoint that it allows you to put that unimportant long-running job in a different queue without delayed other important fast-running jobs.</p>

<p>A typical worker might look like:</p>

<p>```
class ImportantWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker</p>

<p>  def perform(id)</p>

<pre><code># Do the important stuff
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>If we want to send this job to a different queue, we&rsquo;d add <code>sidekiq_options queue: :important</code> to the worker, resulting in:</p>

<p>```
class ImportantWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  sidekiq_options queue: :important</p>

<p>  def perform(id)</p>

<pre><code># Do the important stuff
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Now, we need to make sure the worker process that&rsquo;s running the jobs knows to process jobs off this queue. A typical worker might be invoked with:</p>

<p><code>
bin/sidekiq
</code></p>

<p>Since new jobs going through this worker will end up on the <code>important</code> queue, we want to make sure the worker is processing jobs from the <code>important</code> queue too:</p>

<p><code>
bin/sidekiq -q important -q default
</code></p>

<p><em>Note: Jobs that don&rsquo;t specify a queue will go to the <code>default</code> queue. We have to include the <code>default</code> queue when we using the <code>-q</code> option, otherwise the default queue will be ignored in favor of the queue passed to the <code>-q</code> option.</em></p>

<p>The best part, you don&rsquo;t even have to have multiple worker processes to process jobs from multiple queues. Furthermore, the <code>important</code> queue can be checked twice as often as the <code>default</code> queue:</p>

<p><code>
bin/sidekiq -q important,2 -q default
</code></p>

<p>This flexibility of where jobs are enqueued and how they&rsquo;re processed gives us an incredible amount of freedom when building our applications.</p>

<h2>Extracting Worker to a Microservice</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that we&rsquo;ve deployed your main application to Heroku. The application uses Sidekiq and we&rsquo;ve included a Redis add-on. With the addition of the add-on, our application now has a <code>REDIS_URL</code> environment variable that Sidekiq connects to on startup. We have a web process, and worker process. A pretty standard Rails stack:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/sidekiq/rails-web-worker.png" title="&ldquo;Rails with typical worker process&rdquo;" ></p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s stopping us from using that same <code>REDIS_URL</code> in another application?</strong></p>

<p>Nothing, actually. And if we consider what we know about the isolation of jobs in queue and workers working on specific queues, there&rsquo;s nothing stopping us from having workers for a specific queue in a different application altogether.</p>

<p>Remember <code>ImportantWorker</code>, imagine the logic for that job was better left for a different application. We&rsquo;ll leave that part a little hand-wavey because there still should be a really good reason to do so. But we&rsquo;ll assume you&rsquo;ve thought long and hard about this and decided the core application was not a great place for this job logic.</p>

<p>Extracting the worker a separate application might now look something like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/sidekiq/rails-with-microservice.png" title="&ldquo;Using Sidekiq as a Message Queue between two Rails microservices&rdquo;" ></p>

<h2>Enqueueing Jobs with the Sidekiq Client</h2>

<p>Typically, to enqueue the <code>ImportantWorker</code> above, we&rsquo;d call the following from our application:</p>

<p><code>
ImportantWorker.perform_async(1)
</code></p>

<p>This works great when <code>ImportantWorker</code> is defined in our application. With the expanded stack above, <code>ImportantWorker</code> now lives in a new microservice, which means we don&rsquo;t have access to the <code>ImportantWorker</code> class from within the application. We <em>could</em> define it in the application just so we can enqueue it, with the intent that the application won&rsquo;t process jobs for that worker, but that feels funny to me.</p>

<p>Rather, we can turn to the underlying Sidekiq client API to enqueue the job instead:</p>

<p>```
Sidekiq::Client.push(
  &ldquo;class&rdquo; => &ldquo;ImportantWorker&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;queue&rdquo; => &ldquo;important&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;args&rdquo; => [1]
)</p>

<p>```</p>

<p><em>Note: We have to be sure to define the <code>class</code> as a string <code>"ImportantWorker"</code>, otherwise we&rsquo;ll get an exception during enqueuing because the worker isn&rsquo;t defined in the application.</em></p>

<h2>Processing Sidekiq Jobs from a Microservice</h2>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re pushing jobs to the <code>important</code> queue, but have nothing in our application to process them. In fact, our worker process isn&rsquo;t even looking at that queue:</p>

<p><code>
bin/sidekiq -q default
</code></p>

<p>From our microservice, we setup a worker process to <strong>ONLY</strong> look at the <code>important</code> queue:</p>

<p><code>
bin/sidekiq -q important
</code></p>

<p>We define the <code>ImportantWorker</code> in our microservice:</p>

<p>```
class ImportantWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  sidekiq_options queue: :important</p>

<p>  def perform(id)</p>

<pre><code># Do the important stuff
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>And now when the worker picks jobs out of the <code>important</code> queue, it&rsquo;ll process them using the <code>ImportantWorker</code> defined above in our microservice.</p>

<p>If we wanted to go one step further, the microservice could then enqueue a job using the Sidekiq client API to a queue that only the core application is working on in order to send communication back the other direction.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Any architectural decision has risks. Microservices are no exception. Microservices can be easier than an enterprise message broker, cluster of new servers and a handful of devops headaches.</p>

<p>I originally dubbed this the &ldquo;poor man&rsquo;s message bus&rdquo;. With more thought, there&rsquo;s nothing &ldquo;poor&rdquo; about this. Sidekiq has a been a reliable piece of our infrastructure and I have no reason to believe that&rsquo;ll change, even if we are using it for more than just simple background processing from a single application.</p>

    <link href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/using-the-sucker-punch-ruby-gem-to-cache-stripe-data-in-rails/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-26T20:46:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/using-the-sucker-punch-ruby-gem-to-cache-stripe-data-in-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With so many services available these days, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to find or build an application that doesn&rsquo;t rely on a third-party service. Most developers that have dealt with billing systems within the past few years have likely heard of <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>. Stripe is, by far, the most developer-friendly billing service I&rsquo;ve implemented.</p>

<p>While Stripe does provide a number of features and plugins that make updating a credit card or signing up for a service simple, there are occasions when data needs to be fetched from Stripe in real-time. For these cases, it&rsquo;s great to be able to fetch and cache this data before-hand, and only expire if you know there&rsquo;s been a change.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Combining <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch">Sucker Punch</a> with Rails cache allows you to cache Stripe customer data so that billing pages are just as snappy as the rest of the application.</p>

<h2>The Pain</h2>

<p>Even though Stripe is generally pretty fast, retrieving customer data on the fly can be expensive. In order to optimize page load times, we can look to cache this data before it&rsquo;s actually used.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re familiary with the Stripe gem, you&rsquo;ve probably seen something like this:</p>

<p><code>
customer = Stripe::Customer.retrieve(user.stripe_id)
</code></p>

<p>With the response of <code>customer</code>, we can further query customer data with the following methods:</p>

<p><code>
invoices = customer.invoices
upcoming_invoices = customer.upcoming_invoices
</code></p>

<p>If we make all 3 of these method calls on page load, we&rsquo;d have 3 separate lookups from Stripe. This is pretty common for the typical billing page where you might want to show the customer&rsquo;s current credit card on file, their past invoices, and charges they can expect for the next invoice.</p>

<p>Three lookups like this could potentially add another second or so to page load, which is not ideal.</p>

<p>So how can we improve this?</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>First, we can move the code to fetch the relevant stripe data in to a class of it&rsquo;s own, which wraps the notion of caching around the data retrieval.</p>

<p>```
class StripeCache
  def initialize(user)</p>

<pre><code>@user = user
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def refresh</p>

<pre><code>purge_all
cache_all
self
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def customer</p>

<pre><code>return @customer if @customer

@customer = Rails.cache.fetch(cache_key("customer"), expires_in: 15.minutes) do
  Stripe::Customer.retrieve(user.stripe_id)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def invoices</p>

<pre><code>Rails.cache.fetch(cache_key("invoices"), expires_in: 15.minutes) do
  customer.invoices
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def upcoming_invoice</p>

<pre><code>Rails.cache.fetch(cache_key("upcoming_invoice"), expires_in: 15.minutes) do
  customer.upcoming_invoice
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  private</p>

<p>  attr_reader :user</p>

<p>  def cache_all</p>

<pre><code>customer
invoices
upcoming_invoice
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def purge_all</p>

<pre><code>Rails.cache.delete_matched("#{user.id}/stripe")
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def cache_key(item)</p>

<pre><code>"user/#{user.id}/stripe/#{item}"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>To use this on a billing page, we could do:</p>

<p><code>
stripe = StripeCache.new(current_user).refresh
</code></p>

<p>And from the response of that class, we could access the <code>customer</code>, <code>invoices</code>, and <code>upcoming_invoice</code> respectively:</p>

<p><code>
@customer = stripe.customer
@invoices = stripe.invoices
@upcoming_invoice = stripe.invoices
</code></p>

<p>This is great! All future calls to this customer&rsquo;s Stripe data will be fast &mdash; for 15 minutes, of course.</p>

<p>However, the first time the page is load, the user is still burdened with the initial fetch of the data. So the method above works for every request to the billing page after the first.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s be honest, what users are going to the billing page multiple times during a session? Probably not many. So we still need to fix the initial load somehow.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch">Sucker Punch</a> comes in. Like other Ruby background processing libraries, Sucker Punch allows you to move the processing of code to the background. However, unlike the others, Sucker Punch doesn&rsquo;t require additional infrastructure like Redis, and doesn&rsquo;t require a separate worker process to monitor and execute enqueued jobs. Because of this, the time it takes to extract code to a Sucker Punch job and have it incorporated with your application code is much lower.</p>

<p>In this case, rather than send a transactional email or perform some database calculation, we can write a job thats only responsibility is to run the Stripe caching code.</p>

<p>```
class StripeCacheJob
  include SuckerPunch::Job</p>

<p>  def perform(user)</p>

<pre><code>StripeCache.new(user).refresh
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The next question is, when do you run this?</p>

<p>Well, I chose to run it on user login, but you could run it anywhere you think would give you a head start if the user were about to go to the billing page. In my case, on login meant that if they didn&rsquo;t go to the billing page at all, after 15 minutes the data would be exhausted from the cache anyway, so no hard done.</p>

<p>But if the user did navigate to the billing page during that session, they would have up the latest Stripe customer and invoice data to see &mdash; all without a request to stripe on page load.</p>

<p>One other thing to keep in mind is there may be times when we&rsquo;d want invalidate the Rails cache data. One example would be when the user&rsquo;s card information is updated. In that case, we can slip in another call to the Stripe cache job, which would invalidate the previous cache and re-request the customer&rsquo;s billing information:</p>

<p>```
module Accounts
  class CardsController &lt; ApplicationController</p>

<pre><code>before_action :require_authentication

def create
  cust = StripeCache.new(current_user).customer
  cust.save(card: params[:stripeToken])

  StripeCacheJob.new.async.perform(current_user)

  redirect_to account_path, notice: t("card.update.success")
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Using Sucker Punch in combination with Rails cache feels like a great way make optimizations to third-party data requests. This article focused on using it to fetch Stripe data, but it could be used with another service just as easily.</p>

<p>The beauty of Sucker Punch is that it doesn&rsquo;t require a separate worker process to be running in the background. On a platform like Heroku, this saves the cost of an additional dyno.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch excels at background jobs that are relatively fast and if missed,
wouldn&rsquo;t be critical to the operation. In this case, if a cache job is lost,
it&rsquo;s not the end of the world. At worst, the user&rsquo;s Stripe data would be requested on the fly and the page would be slower than usual. But the majority of the time, the request is fast because the data&rsquo;s been cached beforehand.</p>

<p>What other jobs have you used Sucker Punch for?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What’s the first thing you look at when you see the source code of a Rails project?</p>

<p>For me, it’s the <code>Gemfile</code>. Think about it&hellip;there&rsquo;s very few other files that contain so much information. It describes the building blocks of the application. And at times, you can even see specific features of the application.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>A <code>Gemfile</code> also includes hints about preference and style. And style is something most Ruby developers are very passionate about. It doesn’t take long to find the story of a Rubyist describing their “love at first sight” experience with the language. It’s hard to find another file in a Rails project that’s so telling.</p>

<p>A year ago, I wrote about the <a href="/blog/patterns-in-a-rails-gemfile/">Ruby gems I regularly use in my Rails applications</a>. Because technology and the tools we use change so fast, I thought it’d be interesting to take a look at one of my more recent Gemfiles to see what’s changed.</p>

<h2>Rails Templates</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in the last <a href="/blog/patterns-in-a-rails-gemfile/">Gemfile post</a>, I tend to write a bunch of small applications sprinkled around some larger ones. Despite the size of the project, I feel like I’ve honed in a set of Ruby gems that feel comfortable and productive for me and my workflow.</p>

<p>Knowing the act of bootstrapping a Rails project is sometimes tedious, I took some time to build a <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/rails_templates">Rails template</a> around the gems and patterns I commonly use. I’ll definitely be writing about this experience in the future since there seems to be very little discussion about it.</p>

<p>In short, extracting my preferences to a template has been a HUGE time saver. It no longer feels like a burden to run <code>rails new</code>. I can jump right in and have a consistent set of tools that enable me to be productive within a few minutes.</p>

<h2>My 2014 Gemfile</h2>

<p>The <code>Gemfile</code> below is one of the larger projects I worked on this year. I thought it’d give a good sense of some of my more practical everyday preferences, along with some feature-specific choices for this particular application.</p>

```</p>

<p>A few comments:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I’ve standardized on <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> as the database for my apps, even in development. It’s reliable and allows me to be sure that the code I write will work the same way in production, since I tend to deploy most of my apps to <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I leave <code>turbolinks</code> on. Judging from recent posts and comments within the community, this will probably one of the more controversial decisions.</p>

<p>  If I’m being honest, my first experience with Turbolinks wasn’t great. And by “wasn’t great”, I mean — it broke <strong>EVERYTHING</strong>! But the good news was that it brought to light the fact that I sucked at javascript. At the time, I was capable of writing <em>just</em> enough to modify form behavior or fade in an DOM element.</p>

<p>  The time had come to level up on my javascript skills. I was able to improve my javascript and also do it in a way that can took full advantage of the benefits that Turbolinks offers. Since that time, I’ve left Turbolinks on and no longer had to worry that my client-side code will stop working after clicking through a few application links.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve standardized on using <code>has_secure_password</code> for authentication. I previously used <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">devise</a>, but found the extra features are no longer worth the additional complexity. <code>has_secure_password</code> provides me reliable authentication patterns that are simple to understand and maintain. Hence the need for <code>bcrypt</code> in the <code>Gemfile</code> above.</p></li>
<li><p>As for my test environment, I’ve written about <a href="/blog/7-reasons-why-im-sticking-with-minitest-and-fixtures-in-rails/">my switch to Minitest and fixtures</a>. I’m still just as happy with that decision as the time I wrote about it. I’ve seen Rspec go through a variety of API changes since then, and thankful I no longer have to worry about updating my test suite every couple months. I continue to find value in <code>capybara</code> and include <code>mocha</code> for the times <code>Minitest</code>’s stubbing and mocking isn’t enough (I’ve been meaning to dig in to the places I use <code>mocha</code>. I’m guessing if the code was better, I probably wouldn’t need it at all).</p></li>
<li><p><code>bullet</code> is a killer gem for tracking down performances issues. It’s saved me countless hours of debugging.</p></li>
<li><p>The inclusion of <code>spring</code> in Rails 4.1 is great. I realize it’s a bandaid in some respects, but waiting for the environment to load on every test run is a drag. I’ve found that because my tests are so responsive when <code>spring</code> is working properly, it encourages me to run my tests more often. Once setup, it works well and only in rare cases has not reloaded when it should have.</p></li>
<li><p>I generally always include <code>bootstrap</code> and <code>font-awesome</code> in my projects. Being a non-designer, it helps me get something on the screen faster, even if it’s not the final design.</p></li>
<li><p>I continue to use <code>unicorn</code>. It’s been around for so long and continues to be competitive in benchmarks against other Ruby web servers. I tested Passenger in a few applications, but got scared off when it printed the entire environment to the screen in production on Heroku on an exception. I’m told there are ways around this with some non-trivial configuration, but I think it’s a bizarre default and isn’t conducive to my workflow.</p></li>
<li><p>For the apps that need background processing, <code>sidekiq</code> continues to be my goto when a separate worker is necessary. I generally mount Sidekiq’s web UI to provide insight to the state of the jobs, which is why <code>sinatra</code> is included.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve written about putting together <a href="/blog/relative-timestamps-in-rails/">a gem to render relative timestamps</a> on the client side. While I’d love to sit here and tell you I use it, I don’t. Basecamp’s <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/local_time">local_time</a> gem is exceptional for that need and I’m pretty sure we can count on it being updated and maintained well going forward (one of the biggest changes in my mindset for including a new gem).</p></li>
<li><p>This particular app has some pretty hairy time calculations and scheduling. It’s not something I was very experienced with prior, but found value in the combination of <code>chronic</code> and <code>recurrence</code>. Both make the process of targeting a specific <code>datetime</code> and scheduling something in the future relatively simple.</p></li>
<li><p>I included a number of bootstrap related javascript gems (<code>bootstrap3-datetimepicker-rails</code>, <code>bootstrap-switch-rails</code>, <code>bootstrap-switch-rails</code>, <code>bootstrap-select-rails</code>). All are little more than a <a href="/blog/how-to-build-a-rails-engine/">Rails engine</a> that exposes the appropriate javascript and stylesheets to the asset pipeline. These are particularly dependent on the project. I’d normally not start by including anything like this. Side note &ndash; I could’ve copied the relevant assets to <code>vendor/assets</code> rather than requiring a gem that does the same. In a few cases, some added view helpers as well.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve standardized on using New Relic to collect application metrics and exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p>It shouldn’t be a surprise that <code>stripe</code> is the payment processor I reach for when I’m in control. It’s super developer-friendly and, at this point, I’ve done enough that integration is not much more than a copy/paste from other apps. I recently started using <code>stripe_tester</code> in the test environment. It’s been great for stubbing out calls to Stripe so the test suite continues to be performant. It also allows me to setup some unique edge-case data coming from Stripe so I can protect users from ending up in a crappy state.</p></li>
<li><p>I generally reach for <code>active_model_serializers</code> anytime I need a <code>json</code> response that contains more than a simple hash (in which case I’d continue to render it in the controller response). I’ve used the view equivalent solutions a few times (<code>jbuilder</code>, etc.) and they worked ok too, but for whatever reason, <code>active_model_serializers</code> does it for me.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The rest are very use case-specific. And in general, the defacto solution for each (<code>pusher</code> for real-time features, <code>dalli</code> for memcached, etc.).</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I’m happy with my current toolkit. This doesn’t mean I’m not on the lookout for shiny new things, but I’m generally a little more cautious about replacing something reliable, even if it doesn’t do everything under the sun.</p>

<p>Even though Ruby makes it easy to include third party libraries, it doesn’t mean we always should. As developers, we inherit the stability of the dependencies we include. Even though a gem’s code might be locked away behind a separate git repository, it likely has the same holes and complexities that we’re worried about in our applications. And perhaps, even more…</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/">Ruby toolbox</a> is a great resource when searching for a gem. I generally consider the number of downloads, age of the project and development activity when deciding which one to go with.</p>

<p>What have your favorite gems been this year?</p>

<h2>Build a Ruby Gem</h2>

<p>Ruby gems are the building blocks of Ruby/Rails applications. If you haven’t built one yourself, there’s no better time to start. Github makes it extremely to contribute to existing gems and sometimes that’s <a href="/blog/3-ways-to-get-started-contributing-to-open-source/">the easiest way to get started contributing to open source</a>. My book, <em>Build a Ruby Gem</em>, includes <a href="/books/build-a-ruby-gem/">everything you to need to get started building a Ruby gem</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/absolutes-as-an-antipattern/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-28T22:35:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/absolutes-as-an-antipattern</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been awhile since my last post — almost 2 months to be specific. A trip to Portugal, getting sick and a minor run-in with a table saw made it challenging to post anything for the last couple weeks. But I’d be lying if I said I was itching to write.</p>

<p>During that time, I didn’t have anything screaming to be talked about. I have a long list of “decent post” topics, but none of them got me particularly excited. Until today…</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I stumbled on a blog post related to Rails’s upcoming <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html">Active Job feature</a>. While demonstrating the syntax for specifying the adapter, there was comment in the code snippet that said <em>“inline and other worse options”</em>. This caught me by surprise and bummed me out at the same time. Not only because I’m the author of <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch">one of them</a>, but because there are a handful of background processing libraries in Ruby that are really good.</p>

<p>So, naturally, I pinged the author and mentioned the comment might be sending the wrong message. He responded with “I consider sidekiq to be the best background processing tool available for Ruby.” And then later, <em>“sidekiq is significantly better that delayed_job and resque. You’re welcome to disagree”</em>.</p>

<p><em>Note: The responses above illustrate a general sentiment. By no means is this post focused on the individual that said them.</em></p>

<p>The thing is, I don’t completely disagree. As you probably already know, I’m a huge fan of of <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a>. I’ve contributed to the project and believe Sidekiq’s author, <a href="https://www.mikeperham.com/">Mike Perham</a> is not only a great leader in the Ruby community, but a great example of how to manage and lead open source projects well.</p>

<p>However, those responses reminded me how damaging absolutes can be. You’ve probably heard it before:</p>

<blockquote><p>“we can <strong>ABSOLUTELY NOT</strong> do x, y and z”</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Why not? Will the world end? How do I know?</em></p>

<p>or, what about:</p>

<blockquote><p>“this feature needs to go out tomorrow, no excuses”</p></blockquote>

<p><em>What if there is an excuse? What if it’s not ready? Will I be fired? Will our company go under?</em></p>

<p>There are trade-offs to every decision made. While some options may not be ideal, they may still work, perhaps just not as well.</p>

<p>Absolutes beg the toddler question, <em>”why?”</em>. <em>Why won’t that language X work?</em> <em>Why can’t we use Y?</em>. If you don’t know the answer to those questions, you’re doing yourself a disservice by not asking. Maybe the person has thoroughly researched the topic to come up with those conclusions. But, maybe, they haven’t.</p>

<p>I’ve noticed those who do exhaustive research on a topic tend to present the information in a different manner. They’re confident the facts they found will prove their case and seem to present their findings less defensively. No, <em>”it has to be done like this”</em>. More like, <em>“I found a few ways to fix the problem and here’s why I think option 1 might be the best solution. What do you think?”</em>.</p>

<p>Whether you follow agile or any other methodology, predictions and absolutes have no place in conversations. There are plenty of examples of failed software projects. I’m pretty sure all of them featured people promising the work would be done in time and under budget. Buuuuuuut, it wasn’t.</p>

<h2>Background Jobs for the Big Boys</h2>

<p>Delayed Job was the first Ruby background processing library I used. I remember feeling badass that I was doing all this complicated stuff in the background. But at some point, there we so many jobs and so much activity that pushing and pulling jobs out of the primary data store wasn’t efficient. Reads from the web UI would slow down (and ultimately stop) and users would bail. Unfortunately, I couldn’t pop up a message and say, <em>”hey, hope you don’t mind, but I’m doing some pretty crucial shit in the background here, so you’re experience is gonna be sucky for a bit! sorry :(”</em>.</p>

<p>So, at the time, Resque was the next logical transition. I migrated the previously written jobs from Delayed Job to Resque and experienced a new level of <em>bad ass</em>. Fast forward 4 years — I still work on projects using Resque. Needless to say, it’s a pretty awesome piece of open source software.</p>

<p>A few years ago, Sidekiq came along. While I didn’t know much about multi-threading code in Ruby, I tried it on a side project and was floored at the results. Those 6 Heroku workers that I’d been paying for could be compacted in to 1?!?! And on top of that, I only needed 1 worker that had 25 workers working against the queue?!?!</p>

<p>But then one day, I dropped it in to a project that was using MongoDB and MongoMapper as ORM and things didn’t go so well. In the end, MongoMapper wasn’t thread-safe, which is a requirement of Sidekiq worker code. So in that case, was Sidekiq the best tool for the job? While I would’ve loved to use Sidekiq on that project, it certainly (like the absolute there…) wasn’t the right tool for <em>that</em> job.</p>

<p>And what about when I first started with Delayed Job…we were a small startup with limited cash. While it seems silly to balk over an extra $35 Heorku dyno, it was $35 that could’ve gone towards something else. Not to mention the extra Redis instance, along with the expertise to make sure the thing didn’t fall over and die. Was Sidekiq (or Resque for that matter) the best tool for that job? Nope!</p>

<p>Fast forward a few years, I had the need for an in-process background processing library, so <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/why-i-wrote-the-sucker-punch-gem/">I wrote one</a>. That need was driven off the motivation above — needing to minimize cost and complexity. Would Sidekiq have worked for that project? Of course! In fact, it was using Sidekiq for a year or so before I transitioned the jobs to use Sucker Punch.</p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p>At this point, you should be noticing a trend, right? The examples above were unique use cases with a unique set of requirements and limitations. Sure, if every project I worked on had unlimited resources (both time and money), Sidekiq would be probably be my go-to the majority of time (even when writing that sentence I hesitated and almost wrote “all the time”).</p>

<p>But I hesitate now. Because I remember learning about the new cool things and thinking, <em>”This is the best! There’s no way I’ll never not use it”</em>. And when I would talk to other developers, I would rave about how <em>X</em> is the best for <em>Y</em>. And now I realize I was a dummy for doing that. There’s no way I could’ve made that judgement for someone else and their work. What I really should’ve said was, <em>”I tried [insert fancy new gem/technique] for the first time the other day. It worked really well for doing X in my project that does Y”</em>. That definitely doesn’t sound as exciting, but it was the truth.</p>

<p>I feel fortunate to get to write Ruby everyday. It’s incredibly expressive, which is why the debate over the countless ways to do something is great. Does the code express the right intent? For your method, it might. But for mine, it might express the complete opposite. The good news is, that’s OK. Both versions will work and the fact that we can have conversations like that is a praise for the language itself. I prefer to have the opportunity to have that conversation about style, rather than a language more black and white. Maybe it’s the creative in me, but it seems like no 2 Ruby solutions will be identical and that’s one of the things I love most about writing Ruby.</p>

<p>We often joke about the stack overflow post that starts with <em>“I’m thinking about learning Rails…is it better than PHP?”</em>. Or even more relevant today, <em>”Which javascript framework should I use?”</em>.</p>

<p>And then there’s the guy who comes along and is all like, <em>”Let’s back up, what are you doing and why do you absolutely need a FRAMEWORK????”</em>. While I used to ignore those types of comments, they’re the kind that I think about now and find myself typing. And that has me wondering…why the change?</p>

<h2>Experience, Experience, Experience</h2>

<p>I got to thinking about how I felt when I was first learning to program. When I started to feel comfortable with Rails, my confidence was through the roof. But at the same time, my naivety was at an all time high. I had had minimal experiences with software systems that were either critical or heavily-loaded. But having found Resque, I felt like I could solve the world’s problems. This is somewhat of an exaggeration, but not too far off. I realized that, as it relates to my technical career, my naivety is doing this related to time:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/absolutes/naivety-graph.png" title="&ldquo;Graph of Naivety over Time&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>The less naivety, the more options and, naturally, certainty takes a nose dive:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/absolutes/certainty-graph.png" title="&ldquo;Graph of Certainty over Time&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>The more I learn about programming in general, the more questions I have. Fortunately, experiences have brought me to a point where I can fairly weigh the use of Sucker Punch or Delayed Job for a particular use case. I’m not sure projecting absolutes from up high does anyone any good. Beginners will take it as the word and spread the message to others they come across.</p>

<p>Use cases are real. And the less we force our own biases on people, the faster they’ll realize experience is key and the random guy behind the cat avatar on Stack Overflow might actually be asking the right questions — even if they are convoluted.</p>

<p>Next time you hear an absolute, ask <em>”Why?”</em>.</p>
