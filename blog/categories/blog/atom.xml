    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I posted a blog post yesterday, so the first thing I did when I woke up this
morning was look at Google Analytics to for the most popular traffic sources. I
found the following:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blogcopy/rubyconn.png" title="&ldquo;Rubyconn&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Never having heard of it before, I clicked it. I then clicked one of the first links on
the page and saw this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blogcopy/other.png" title="&ldquo;Blog copy&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my blog:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blogcopy/myblog.png" title="&ldquo;Brandon Hilkert&rsquo;s blog&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Wow! Full-on copy of my blog design. The blog title &ldquo;build_something!&rdquo; was even
the title of a previous blog post <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/build-something/">Build
Something</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://blog.rkcudjoe.com/">copied blog</a> has a Github link so I clicked it.
And sure enough&hellip;my entire repo (not even forked). Just a local clone, showing
mostly commits by me.</p>

<p>Now, you&rsquo;re probably asking yourself why I put it on Github in the first place.
Honestly, it&rsquo;s the perfect backup. And I never thought any one would copy the
entire thing!</p>

<p>I spent several months with the help of a <a href="http://jodyferry.com/">really talented UI
designer</a> to finalize my blog design. And in the end,
was really happy with the outcome.</p>

<p>The whole thing is disappointing&hellip;sure I could try to ignore it, but after
investing that much time, it&rsquo;s a bummer to see your work copied in 5 minutes
without care or inquiry.</p>

<p>So the question is&hellip;what would you do?</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Even after several requests to take the design down, the person in
question has disagreed, even without my consent to use the code.</p>
