    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/a-ruby-refactor-exploring-dependency-injection-options</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently wrote some code to interface with Stripe’s webhooks. After looking at the code and tests, I decided I needed to do something to make it easier to test <em>all</em> pricing tiers— something I wasn’t able to easily do from the start.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency injection</a> was a necessary piece of that puzzle. I’ve always been curious about the various forms of dependency injection and the effects each would have on the code. Below I explore 2 options (constructor injection and setter injection).</p>

<!--more-->


<p>In the end, setter injection felt for more natural for this case and it didn’t interfere with the classes argument list and felt ancillary to the responsibility of the code. While the change in code was small, it has a huge impact on my confidence in the code and associated tests.</p>

<h2>The Code</h2>

<p>The class below is responsible for handling Stripe’s <code>invoice.created</code> webhook. Prior to a customer being billed monthly subscription, Stripe will ping your application (if configured) — giving you the opportunity to add additional line items (think metered billing…). It could be additional services, or perhaps the entire bill itself (this use case). Nevertheless, the responsibility of the class is to create an invoice item based on the customer’s usage during the previous period.</p>

<p>```
module StripeEvent
  class InvoiceCreated</p>

<pre><code>attr_reader :payload

def initialize(payload)
  @payload = payload
end

def perform
  Stripe::InvoiceItem.create(
    customer: user.stripe_id,
    amount: additional_charges_in_cents,
    currency: "usd",
    description: "Usage charges"
  )
end

private

def additional_charges_in_cents
  Billing::Tier.new(usage).additional_charges_in_cents
end

def usage
  Billing::Usage.new(user).last_30_days
end

def user
  @user ||= User.find_by(stripe_id: payload["data"]["object"]["customer"])
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>I wrote this code pretty quickly and felt pretty good about it. The responsibility of determining the pricing tier had been broken out in to a separate class, as well as determining the customer’s actual usage. At least I thought they were…</p>

<p>So what about the tests?</p>

<p>```
require &lsquo;test_helper&rsquo;</p>

<p>class InvoiceCreatedTest &lt; ActiveSupport::TestCase
  def setup</p>

<pre><code>@payload = {
  "data" =&gt; {
    "object" =&gt; {
      "customer" =&gt; "stripe_brandon"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds invoice item based on usage&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 1900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
).returns(true)
StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload).perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds next level charge for usage&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stat.create!(user: users(:brandon), step: steps(:nav_one), impressions: 3_000, date: 5.days.ago)

Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 4900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
).returns(true)
StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload).perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed with this setup was the detailed usage of <code>Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects</code>. I wasn’t sure if this was necessarily a bad thing because it was a third-party service and it seemed like reasonable boundary of the application.</p>

<p>Aside from the mock, another thing that bothered me was the difficulty simulating different pricing tiers and customer usage. You probably noticed the <code>Stat.create!…</code> in the last test. I could’ve duplicated <code>Stat</code> entries until I reached some arbitrary level of usage that bumped this user to the next pricing tier. But that felt risky and very dependent on knowing the actual value of the subsequent tier.</p>

<p>What if I wanted to change the ceiling of that tier next month? I’d have to come in here and adjust the stats being created until it totaled something above the adjustment. It just felt weird…</p>

<p>What if we had a way to easily swap in implementations of the <code>Billing::Usage</code>? It would then allow me to concoct any combination of usage and mock the expected values sent to Stripe.</p>

<h2>Setter Injection</h2>

<p>In a few other articles, I’ve heard this termed “accessors as collaborators”. Whatever the name, it was surprising how such a little a change could produce so much flexibility in my tests. And with that additional flexibility came confidence because it allowed me to test the edge cases with minimal overhead.</p>

<p>```
module StripeEvent
  class InvoiceCreated</p>

<pre><code>attr_writer :usage_service
attr_reader :payload

def initialize(payload)
  @payload = payload
end

def perform
  if user.created_at &lt; 14.days.ago
    Stripe::InvoiceItem.create(
      customer: user.stripe_id,
      amount: additional_charges_in_cents,
      currency: "usd",
      description: "Usage charges"
    )
  end
end

private

def additional_charges_in_cents
  Billing::Tier.new(usage).additional_charges_in_cents
end

def usage
  usage_service.last_30_days
end

def usage_service
  @usage_service ||= Billing::Usage.new(user)
end

def user
  @user ||= User.find_by(stripe_id: payload["data"]["object"]["customer"])
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>A couple things changed:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>usage_service</code> was created to extract the code to calculate customer usage</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>usage</code> method now calls the <code>last_30_days</code> method on <code>usage_service</code></p>

<p> This is interesting because you’ll notice now that the only important idea about <code>usage_service</code> is the   fact that is has a <code>last_30_days</code> method. We can now take comfort in the idea that <code>usage_service</code> could    be anything really, as long as it implements the <code>last_30_days</code> method.</p></li>
<li><p><code>attr_writer :usage_service</code> was added to allow for other implementations of the usage class</p></li>
</ol>


<p>This allows us to inject other forms of the <code>usage_service</code> to simulate more or less customer usage:</p>

<p>```
require &lsquo;test_helper&rsquo;</p>

<p>class InvoiceCreatedTest &lt; ActiveSupport::TestCase
  def setup</p>

<pre><code>@payload = {
  "data" =&gt; {
    "object" =&gt; {
      "customer" =&gt; "stripe_brandon"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds invoice item based on usage&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 1900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
)
StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload).perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds next level charge for usage&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stat.create!(user: users(:brandon), step: steps(:nav_one), impressions: 3_000, date: 5.days.ago)

Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 4900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
)
StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload).perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds highest tier&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 49900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
)
inv = StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload)
inv.usage_service = Level5Usage.new
inv.perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds 2nd highest tier&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 24900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
)
inv = StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload)
inv.usage_service = Level4Usage.new
inv.perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds middle tier&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 12900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
)
inv = StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload)
inv.usage_service = Level3Usage.new
inv.perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds 2nd tier&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 4900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
)
inv = StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload)
inv.usage_service = Level2Usage.new
inv.perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds 1st tier&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 1900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
)
inv = StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload)
inv.usage_service = Level1Usage.new
inv.perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  private</p>

<p>  Level5Usage = Class.new { def last_30_days; 2_000_000; end }
  Level4Usage = Class.new { def last_30_days; 900_000; end }
  Level3Usage = Class.new { def last_30_days; 190_000; end }
  Level2Usage = Class.new { def last_30_days; 19_000; end }
  Level1Usage = Class.new { def last_30_days; 1_900; end }
```</p>

<p>I’ve created classes for each usage tier that implement the <code>last_30_days</code> method. In real life, this usage service is more complex, but we can test the complexity of it alone through unit tests. The responsibility of this class is to ensure invoice items are added to Stripe correctly, so removing the complexity of <code>Billing::Usage</code> form this test allows us to maximize this test’s value and keep us isolated from the implementation of <code>Billing::Usage</code> — assuming it implements the <code>last_30_days</code> method.</p>

<h2>Constructor Injection</h2>

<p>Most dependency injection posts focus on constructor injection. The idea being that an implementation can be supplied. If not, a reasonable default will be provided. How might that change this scenario?</p>

<p>```
module StripeEvent
  class InvoiceCreated</p>

<pre><code>attr_reader :payload

def initialize(payload, usage_service = Billing::Usage)
  @payload = payload
  @usage_service = usage_service
end

def perform
  if user.created_at &lt; 14.days.ago
    Stripe::InvoiceItem.create(
      customer: user.stripe_id,
      amount: additional_charges_in_cents,
      currency: "usd",
      description: "Usage charges"
    )
  end
end

private

def additional_charges_in_cents
  Billing::Tier.new(usage).additional_charges_in_cents
end

def usage
  @usage_service.new(user).last_30_days
end

def user
  @user ||= User.find_by(stripe_id: payload["data"]["object"]["customer"])
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Because the <code>usage</code> method requires instantiation from within the class, I had to update the fake test Usage classes to accept <code>user</code> as an argument during instantiation:</p>

<p>```
require &lsquo;test_helper&rsquo;</p>

<p>class InvoiceCreatedTest &lt; ActiveSupport::TestCase
  def setup</p>

<pre><code>@payload = {
  "data" =&gt; {
    "object" =&gt; {
      "customer" =&gt; "stripe_brandon"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds invoice item based on usage&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 1900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
)
StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload).perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds next level charge for usage&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stat.create!(user: users(:brandon), step: steps(:nav_one), impressions: 3_000, date: 5.days.ago)

Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 4900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
)
StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload).perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds highest tier&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 49900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
)
inv = StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload, Level5Usage)
inv.perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds 2nd highest tier&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 24900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
)
inv = StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload, Level4Usage)
inv.perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds middle tier&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 12900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
)
inv = StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload, Level3Usage)
inv.perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds 2nd tier&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 4900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
)
inv = StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload, Level2Usage)
inv.perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  test &lsquo;adds 1st tier&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>Stripe::InvoiceItem.expects(:create).with(
  customer: "stripe_brandon",
  amount: 1900,
  currency: "usd",
  description: "Usage charges"
)
inv = StripeEvent::InvoiceCreated.new(@payload, Level1Usage)
inv.perform
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  private</p>

<p>  Level5Usage = Struct.new(:user) { def last_30_days; 2_000_000; end }
  Level4Usage = Struct.new(:user) { def last_30_days; 900_000; end }
  Level3Usage = Struct.new(:user) { def last_30_days; 190_000; end }
  Level2Usage = Struct.new(:user) { def last_30_days; 19_000; end }
  Level1Usage = Struct.new(:user) { def last_30_days; 1_900; end }
```</p>

<p>The resulting test classes seem overly complex and sprinkled with details that aren’t particularly relevant to its responsibility. If we were to pass in an already instantiated usage class as an argument, it means we would have to already know the user before-hand, which means we’d have to parse <code>@user ||= User.find_by(stripe_id: payload["data"]["object"]["customer”])</code> outside of this class. I don’t love that solution — the parent that calls this <code>InvoiceCreated</code> class is pretty minimal and I wanted to keep it that way.</p>

<p>Another option would be to provide <code>user</code> as an argument to the to the <code>last_30_days</code> method:</p>

<p><code>
def usage
  @usage_service.new.last_30_days(user)
end
</code></p>

<p>We could then change our fake test usage classes back to:</p>

<p><code>
Level1Usage = Class.new { def last_30_days; 1_900; end }
</code></p>

<p>Notice the lack of <code>Struct</code> with an argument…</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Of the two options, I prefer the setter injector in this case. There’s something about changing the signature of a class just for tests that didn’t feel natural.</p>

<p>An accessor (or writer…), in this case, provided the same flexibility without changing the signature. I like being able to quickly look at the argument list of <code>initialize</code> and clearly understand its roles and responsibilities within the system.</p>

<p>Which do you prefer?</p>

    <link href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/refactoring-logic-from-a-rails-view/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-30T06:03:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/refactoring-logic-from-a-rails-view</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s generally known that leaving any kind of logic in a Rails view is bad news, both for debugging and your own sanity. Rails views can be cumbersome to test and leave a lot to be desired when it comes to debugging.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I recently went through the process of refactoring a Rails view that included logic. The end result was an isolated <a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2007/10/ruby-poro.html">PORO</a> that was easily integrated with the controller/view.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The app I’m currently working on is a greenfield app with vague specs, at best. I don’t mention this to fault anyone, but more to illustrate a point. Not all greenfield projects have well-defined specs.</p>

<p>In this particular case, the stakeholders were somewhat unsure of what the interface should look like. Together, we tossed around a number of ideas, ultimately leading to a few options. Only once an iteration of the UI was available, would we have a clear picture of whether it <em>felt right</em>.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>I implemented the first option in the most crude way I could think of. Unfortunately, that way involved putting logic in the view. I know, I know — I can hear it now, <em>”C’mon Brandon, everyone knows you shouldn’t do this!”</em>. Here’s the thing — I knew it too.</p>

<p>Here’s what I ended up with:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>controller</h1>

<p>def people
  @week_of = params[:week_of] || Checkin::Week.recent(current_company).first.beginning
  @people = current_user.reports
end</p>

<h1>view</h1>

<p>&lt;% @people.each do |person| %>
  &lt;% checkin = person.checkin_for(@week_of) %>
  <tr></p>

<pre><code>&lt;td&gt;
  &lt;%= profile_picture person %&gt;
  &lt;%= person %&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
  &lt;%= checkin_status(checkin) %&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>  </tr>
&lt;% end %>
```</p>

<p>For each iteration of <code>@people</code>, I looked up the check-in for that particular week from the model:</p>

<p><code>
def checkin_for(week_of)
  Checkin.find_by(user_id: id, week_of: week_of)
end
</code></p>

<p>This crosses concerns, blurs responsibility — all the things that bad Rails app are made of. But I was doing this knowing it would either be entirely ripped out (we’d change the UI altogether), or refactored to something better.</p>

<p><em>Note: I could’ve just saved myself one step and never made the method in the model. For some reason, that made me feel better about it at the time. *shrugs*</em></p>

<p>So I added a Github issue and went on my way…</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/view-refactor/gh-issue.png" title="&ldquo;Github issue to refactor Rails view&rdquo;" ></p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>With a few minor tweaks, this implementation of the functionality and UI was adequate. So as time allowed, I jumped back in to untangling the mess I created.</p>

<p>The biggest variable in the display of a <code>Checkin</code> was the week (a date field corresponding to the beginning of that particular week). Once the date was known, I could look for a <code>Checkin</code> for each user in my visibility, see if it existed, and if not, return a stand-in object to represent a non-completed check-in.</p>

<p>I removed the model method:</p>

<p><code>
def checkin_for(week_of)
  Checkin.find_by(user_id: id, week_of: week_of)
end
</code></p>

<p>and the line in the view largely responsible for the mess:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;% checkin = person.checkin_for(@week_of) %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>I went back to the controller and initialized a new object that would allow me to iterate over a list of check-ins:</p>

<p><code>
def people
  @week_of = params[:week_of] || Checkin::Week.recent(current_company).first.beginning
  @reports = Checkin::Reports.new(current_user, @week_of)
end
</code></p>

<p>Let’s dig in to the new <code>Checkin::Reports</code> class…</p>

<p>```
class Checkin
  class Reports</p>

<pre><code>def initialize(user, week_of)
  @user, @week_of = user, week_of
end

def checkins
  reports.map { |person|
    Checkin.find_or_initialize_by(user_id: person.id, week_of: week_of)
  }
end

private

attr_reader :user, :week_of

def reports
  user.reports
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>I instantiate with the user and week, similar to what the <code>checkin_for</code> model method did above.</p>

<p>The only relatively interesting part of this class is that it’s using <code>find_or_intialize_by</code>. It turns out that the view didn’t care if the object was <code>nil</code>, or just a non-persisted <code>Checkin</code> object. All it did was interrogate certain attributes of the object, and guard against the argument being <code>nil</code>. From that perspective, we’ve improved our code even more because now instead of supplying nil to the helper, we are actually supplying it with a newly instantiated <code>Checkin</code> with some default attributes.</p>

<p>This means that our <code>checkin_status</code> helper, went from:</p>

<p>```
def checkin_status(checkin)
  if checkin &amp;&amp; checkin.completed_at?</p>

<pre><code>fa_icon("check-square-o", class: "green") + " Submitted #{local_time checkin.completed_at, format: :short_month_day }".html_safe
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>fa_icon("warning", class: "yellow") + " Not completed"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>to:</p>

<p>```
def checkin_status(checkin)
  if checkin.completed_at?</p>

<pre><code>fa_icon("check-square-o", class: "green") + " Submitted #{local_time checkin.completed_at, format: :short_month_day }".html_safe
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>fa_icon("warning", class: "yellow") + " Not completed"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>It’s a subtle change (removing the check <code>if checkin</code> from the first conditional), but one that’s less susceptible to bizarre edge cases. And clearer — It’s reasonable to expect that by calling the first argument <code>checkin</code>, <strong>the variable should be a <code>Checkin</code></strong>, and not sometimes <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>Returning back to the view…using the new <code>@reports</code> variable, we no longer have to query during each iteration:</p>

<p>```
&lt;% @reports.checkins.each do |checkin| %>
  <tr></p>

<pre><code>&lt;td&gt;
  &lt;%= profile_picture checkin.user %&gt;
  &lt;%= checkin.user %&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
  &lt;%= checkin_status(checkin) %&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>  </tr>
&lt;% end %>
```</p>

<p>Tests pass, and we’re in a much better place than we were before.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I’ve seen a lot of people make notes for themselves to improve areas of their application and either never get the opportunity to go back and do so, or get so far removed from the mess, they forget about how bad it was in the first place. The approach I took above by making a note for myself worked because <strong>I knew</strong> I would go back to it. It’s possible this may not work for everyone.</p>

<p>If it takes more than just making a Github issue for your and your team, find what works. The important part is that the refactor takes place, in whatever way convenient for you.</p>

<p>The idea of not putting logic in a Rails view is well regarded as a best practice. Don’t think that just because I did it above, I’m advocating that it’s ok. To me, it’s only acceptable if you go back at a later time (soonish…) and clean it up.</p>

<p>Leaving little bits of bad practice sprinkled all of your app is heading of for a bad time. As <a href="http://www.sandimetz.com/">Sandi Metz</a> says, <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/presenters/211-sandi-metz">“go ahead, make a mess”</a>. Just be sure to come back and clean it up.</p>
