    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The asset pipeline has made including javascript in Rails applications a breeze. Without any additional changes, the code included in your app is executed on every page. However, with a combination of CSS class scopes and a jQuery plugin, you can isolate certain javascript code to only run on specific pages.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Imagine you have 2 pages in your application (landing and contact) and need an alert box to show up on the contact page only. How would you do it?</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Traditionally, if it&rsquo;s something small, you might bite the bullet and just include it in the view template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% # app/views/page/contact.html.erb %&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Contact&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the contact page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;%= javascript_tag do %&gt;
  alert("My example alert box.");
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To me, this always felt dirty. Mixing UI and javascript concerns in an HTML template is easy to forget. Imagine your app has matured and want to change the message of the alert box. Rather than find an associated javascript file (the logical path), you&rsquo;re forced to dig through HTML to find the alert box text.</p>

<p>Another solution is to insert our javascript in to its own file:</p>

<pre><code>// app/assets/javascripts/alert.js

alert("My example alert box.");
</code></pre>

<p>And including this file only in the view we want it to execute:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%# app/views/page/contact.html.erb %&gt;

&lt;%= javascript_include_tag "alert" %&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Contact&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the contact page&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to include your new file in the list of files to be compiled:</p>

<pre><code># config/environments/production.rb

config.assets.precompile += %w( alert.js )
</code></pre>

<p>Like the previous solution, it too, mixes the concerns of HTML and javascript, but introduces a new problem &ndash; this javascript file is included and download separately from the rest of the app&rsquo;s asset. This causes the browser to make another request to the server, thus increasing the page load time and in turn, causing bad bad user pain (Ok, maybe not that bad…). But it’s still not ideal.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>The solution I&rsquo;ve found the most elegant requires adding CSS classes to the layout&rsquo;s body tag and using the <a href="https://github.com/Verba/jquery-readyselector">jquery-readyselector plugin</a>.</p>

<p>First, in order to scope the pages through CSS selectors, let&rsquo;s add some classes to our layout:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%# app/views/layouts/application.html.erb %&gt;

&lt;body class="&lt;%= controller_name %&gt; &lt;%= action_name %&gt;"&gt;
  &lt;%= yield %&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming your <code>contact</code> page action was inside a controller named <code>PagesController</code>, the rendered result would be the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body class="pages contact"&gt;
  ...
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Add <a href="https://raw.github.com/Verba/jquery-readyselector/master/jquery.readyselector.js">this small bit of javavascript code</a> to a new file: <code>vendor/assets/javascripts/jquery-readyselector.js</code>.</p>

<p>Include the new plugin in the <code>application.js</code> manifest file:</p>

<pre><code>...
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require jquery-readyselector
//= require_tree .
</code></pre>

<p>Like before, let&rsquo;s put the javascript code in an isolated asset file, but scope it to the page:</p>

<pre><code>// app/assets/javascripts/alert.js.coffee

$(".pages.contact").ready -&gt;
  alert "My example alert box."
</code></pre>

<p>Because this file is picked up with the <code>//= require_tree .</code> line in the <code>application.js</code> manifest, there’s no additional step to load the asset. And that&rsquo;s it! Your <em>fancy</em> alert box will now only run on your contact page.</p>

<p>Let me what you think of this solution and if you’ve come across this issue before. I&rsquo;d love to hear about other solutions!</p>

<p><em>Note: In order for this solution to work with Turbolinks in Rails 4, I had to drag in the <a href="https://github.com/kossnocorp/jquery.turbolinks">jquery.turbolinks plugin</a>.</em></p>

    <link href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/relative-timestamps-in-rails/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-13T07:01:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/relative-timestamps-in-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook’s news feed popularized the relative timestamp format of &ldquo;X hours ago&rdquo;. For good reason too&hellip;why print an absolute timestamp so that people have to do the relative calculation in their head? It’s one less step for the user, and to be fair, pretty easy to implement.</p>

<h2>Rails helpers to the rescue</h2>

<p>Rails has a view helper aptly named <code>time_ago_in_words</code>. If you use the
<code>created_at</code> attribute from a record, you could easily reference a relative timestamp from a corresponding view:</p>

<pre><code># app/views/posts/show.html.erb

Posted: &lt;%= time_ago_in_words(post.created_at) %&gt; ago
</code></pre>

<p>That’s great! But not enough…what happens when a user stays on the page for 10 min. and the latest post was no longer posted &ldquo;1 minute ago”? Asking them to refresh the page every 10 minutes is no longer an acceptable answer.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Additionally, Rails 4 encourages the use of <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html">Russian doll caching</a>, so if you cached record and use <code>time_ago_in_words</code>, the relative time of the post would never change. No bueno!</p>

<p>Fortunately, we can do better…</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p><a href="http://timeago.yarp.com/">Timeago.js</a> is a <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> plugin that converts timestamps to a relative format. They also boast the following on their website:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Avoid timestamps dated &ldquo;1 minute ago&rdquo; even though the page was opened 10 minutes ago; timeago refreshes automatically</p></li>
<li><p>You can take full advantage of page caching in your web applications, because the timestamps aren&rsquo;t calculated on the server</p></li>
<li><p>You get to use microformats like the cool kids</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The Implementation</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Download the plugin and place it in <code>vendor/javascripts/timeago.jquery.js</code></p></li>
<li><p>Add the following line to your <code>application.js</code> manifest file, so it&rsquo;s picked up by the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">asset pipeline</a>:</p>

<pre><code> //= require jquery.timeago
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Create a helper that you can use from your views that will do the dirty work for you:</p>

<pre><code> # app/helpers/time.rb
 module TimeHelper
   def timeago(time, options = {})
     options[:class] ||= "timeago"
     content_tag(
       :time,
       time.to_s,
       options.merge(datetime: time.getutc.iso8601)
     ) if time
   end
 end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Reference the new helper method from your view &ndash; passing in the time attribute of the model:</p>

<pre><code> # app/views/posts/show.html.erb
 Posted: &lt;%= timeago(post.created_at) %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p> This generates the following HTML tag:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;time class="timeago" datetime="2013-11-08T20:05:37Z"&gt;&lt;/time&gt;
</code></pre>

<p> Now that <code>timeago.js</code> is loaded and you have the right HTML tags on the page, you need to invoke the plugin and let it do its thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the following to the bottom of your layout and reload the page:</p>

<pre><code> # app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
 &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;%= javascript_tag do %&gt;
     $(function() {
       $("time.timeago").timeago();
     });
   &lt;% end %&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p> Once the <code>timeago()</code> function is called, the timestamp above will look like:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;time class="timeago" datetime="2013-11-08T20:05:37Z"
 title="2013-11-08 20:05:37 UTC"&gt;2 days ago&lt;/time&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>


<p>And that&rsquo;s it&hellip;sit on the page long enough and watch the timestamps increment. You&rsquo;ve now got yourself a solution that is dynamic and allows you to cache the views until the cows come home!</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Even though Rails has a simple mechanism for displaying relative timestamps in views, moving this functionality to the client side makes sense.</p>

<p>Another benefit you get is timezone interpretation. Even though we print the UTC time in the HTML tag, the plugin will detect the local timezone from the browser and adjust accordingly. In my experience, timezones are a huge pain and the more you can offload them to a solution like this, the better.</p>

<p>Happy time-stamping!</p>

<p><em>Note: Since writing this, I discovered the <a href="https://github.com/37signals/local_time">local_time gem</a> from 37Signals. They’ve been a big advocate of moving relative timestamp calculation to the client-side. Their gem uses <a href="http://momentjs.com/">moment.js</a> instead of timago.js and it includes <a href="https://github.com/37signals/local_time/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/local_time.js.coffee#L157">code to update the timestamps if Turbolinks is being used</a>. It’s worth checking out if you do this on a regular basis or use the moment.js library for other reasons.</em></p>

<p>P.S. In my book, <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/books/build-a-ruby-gem/?utm_source=bh-com&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=relative-timestamps-post">Build a Ruby Gem</a>, I cover how to create a Rails engine gem with the above functionality.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-06T06:15:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/how-i-launched-an-email-course</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago, I joined <a href="http://jfdi.bz/">JFDI.bz</a> &ndash; a community for
solo-founders launching their own thing. Once a month, the group engages in a
<em>Week of Hustle</em> &ndash; a week long sprint to launch something.
I chose to launch an email course on the topic of <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/courses/build-a-ruby-gem/?utm_source=bh-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=woh-summary">building a Ruby
gem</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Why <em>Build a Ruby Gem</em>?</h2>

<p>A few years ago, I was building my first Ruby gem and I was left pretty
confused with the process and conventions. After working through my
frustrations, I thought the information I learned could be useful to others.</p>

<p>Honestly, I thought to write an eBook at first, however, the last thing I
wanted was to invest a month or two of my time only to find out people
weren&rsquo;t interested.</p>

<p>An email course was a good medium &ndash; I could cover the basics well enough to get
people through their hangups, while also validating the need for an eBook. I
figured if I got <strong>100-200</strong> people to sign up for the course, I would move
forward with the book.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>It turns out my marketing efforts were more successful than I anticipated.</p>

<h3>Today, almost 600 people have taken the Build a Ruby Gem email course!</h3>

<h2>Email is King&hellip;still</h2>

<p>Prior to launching this email course, I&rsquo;d read about the value of building an
email list from people like <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/">Nathan Barry</a>, <a href="http://unicornfree.com/">Amy
Hoy</a> and <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/">Justin Jackson</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also read countless other posts describing the most common regrets when
launching a new product. Almost all of them included not building an email
list. With that said, it was one of the first things I setup.</p>

<p>I blogged each day about my progress. Each post had a
mailing list subscription form that sent them subsequent daily updates.  Subscriptions
were slow at first, but interest built.  By then end of the week <strong>232</strong> people had
subscribed. And the day the course went live, I was able to to convert <strong>115</strong>
(~50%) of them.</p>

<p>The people subscribed were <strong>EXACTLY</strong> my target audience so it&rsquo;s no surprise
conversion was high.</p>

<h2>Finding Your Target Audience</h2>

<p>Fortunately for me, my target audience was Ruby developers and they hang out
online (surprise, surprise). But where online&hellip;</p>

<p>Let me hit you with something that seems obvious in hindsight:</p>

<h3>Marketing is easy when you build a product for an audience you&rsquo;re already part of.</h3>

<p>This was something I&rsquo;d <a href="http://unicornfree.com/2013/how-do-you-create-a-product-people-want-to-buy">read over the past few
months</a>,
but not seen its value until now.</p>

<p>The email course is for <strong>Ruby developers</strong>, I&rsquo;m a <strong>Ruby Developer</strong>, so the
question becomes&hellip;.<em>where do I hang out online?</em></p>

<p>That question is <strong>easy</strong> to answer &ndash; <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby weekly</a>,
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby">Reddit</a> and
<a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/">RubyFlow</a>.</p>

<p>And don&rsquo;t you know&hellip;it turns out those 3 sources have been the highest
converting sources since the course launched:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ruby weekly &ndash; 131</li>
<li>RubyFlow &ndash; 65</li>
<li>Reddit &ndash; 62</li>
</ol>


<p>The remaining sources were a combination of direct links, social media and
other technology news aggregation sites (probably mostly stemming from the top
sources above).</p>

<p><em>Note: I&rsquo;ve been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/80-20-Sales-Marketing-Definitive/dp/1599185059">80/20 Sales and
Marketing</a>
and the numbers above coincide, almost exactly, to the 80/20 curve. That is,
80% of the conversion came from 20% of the sources.</em></p>

<h2>Twitter Tip</h2>

<p>The last day of the email course has a <em>Summary</em> section thanking people for
taking the course and attempting to get feedback. While I haven&rsquo;t received much
constructive criticism, I dropped this little doozie at the bottom:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/email-course/click-to-tweet.png" title="&ldquo;Build a Ruby Gem Email Course Click To Tweet&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d read a post about <a href="http://grinnick.com/posts/how-groove-s-email-copy-makes-their-posts-go-viral?ref=hn">GroveHQ&rsquo;s emails going
viral</a>
and this was something they did in their campaigns.</p>

<p>The link allows people to click and immediately be setup to Tweet the
following:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/email-course/course-tweet.png" title="&ldquo;Build a Ruby Gem Email Course Tweet&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to determine the value of those tweets, but over 10 people have
clicked and tweeted. To me, this was surprising, but valuable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll probably look to make it stand out a bit more to hopefully improve the
click-through.</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>I spent a total of <strong>16 hours</strong> creating the <em>Build a Ruby Gem</em> email
course, which has since <strong>validated the need for a book</strong>. While interest
in a free email course doesn&rsquo;t guarantee a book on the same subject will sell, it was
the closet thing I could think to do outside of taking pre-orders.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started writing the <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/books/build-a-ruby-gem/?utm_source=bh-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=woh-summary"><em>Build a Ruby Gem</em>
book</a>.

    <updated>2013-12-19T18:44:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/flexible-rails-environment-configuration</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s hard to write a Rails app without interfacing with an external service or
API. In most cases, these services require a secret token or password. Since
checking passwords in to source control is generally a bad practice, we need a
good way to safely and reliably access these values in code.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried a few gems that attempt to make this process easier and ultimately
settled on a simpler solution &ndash; the combination of a few lines of code and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable">ENV variables</a>, which are
accessible whether you manage your own infrastructure or use a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a> service like
<a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>In a recent Rails app, I used <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher</a> and it requires the
unique URL to be setup in an initializer:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>config/initializers/pusher.rb</h1>

<p>Pusher.url = &ldquo;<a href="http://asdfa@api.pusherapp.com">http://asdfa@api.pusherapp.com</a>&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>If I need to set this URL in multiple place &ndash; copying/pasting is not a great
solution because it sets me up for copy/paste errors. It&rsquo;s also a headache to
find all occurrences of the URL when it changes.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>Setup a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">yaml</a> file similar to this:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>config/application.yml</h1>

<p>defaults: &amp;defaults
  PUSHER_URL: <a href="http://asdfa@api.pusherapp.com">http://asdfa@api.pusherapp.com</a></p>

<p>development:
  &lt;&lt;: *defaults</p>

<p>test:
  &lt;&lt;: *defaults
```</p>

<p>Add the following to <code>config/application.rb</code> before the Rails application class
is defined:</p>

<p>```
if File.exists?(File.expand_path(&lsquo;../application.yml&rsquo;, <strong>FILE</strong>))
  config = YAML.load(File.read(File.expand_path(&lsquo;../application.yml&rsquo;, <strong>FILE</strong>)))
  config.merge! config.fetch(Rails.env, {})
  config.each do |key, value|</p>

<pre><code>ENV[key] ||= value.to_s unless value.kind_of? Hash
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Resulting in a <code>config/application.rb</code> that looks something like this:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>config/application.rb</h1>

<p>require File.expand_path(&lsquo;../boot&rsquo;, <strong>FILE</strong>)</p>

<p>require &lsquo;rails/all&rsquo;</p>

<h1>Require the gems listed in Gemfile, including any gems</h1>

<h1>you&rsquo;ve limited to :test, :development, or :production.</h1>

<p>Bundler.require(:default, Rails.env)</p>

<p>if File.exists?(File.expand_path(&lsquo;../application.yml&rsquo;, <strong>FILE</strong>))
  config = YAML.load(File.read(File.expand_path(&lsquo;../application.yml&rsquo;, <strong>FILE</strong>)))
  config.merge! config.fetch(Rails.env, {})
  config.each do |key, value|</p>

<pre><code>ENV[key] ||= value.to_s unless value.kind_of? Hash
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>module NewApp
  class Application &lt; Rails::Application</p>

<pre><code># ...
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The added code first looks for an <code>application.yml</code> file. If it finds one, it
reads in the values for that environment (development, test, production, etc.)
and merges them in to the existing Ruby ENV hash.</p>

<p><em>Note: Since <code>application.yml</code> will typically hold passwords and other secret
keys, it should be added to <code>.gitignore</code> so they don&rsquo;t end up in source
control.</em></p>

<p>Now, when the application is initialized, <code>PUSHER_URL</code> is
available in the ENV hash. This allows me to the update the pusher initializer to:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>config/initializers/pusher.rb</h1>

<p>Pusher.url = ENV[&ldquo;PUSHER_URL&rdquo;]
```</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m deploying to Heroku, I need to set the config value using the following
command:</p>

<p><code>heroku config:set PUSHER_URL=http://asdfa@api.pusherapp.com</code></p>

<p>Or if I&rsquo;m deploying to Ubuntu, I can set the ENV variable for all users on the system:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>/etc/environment</h1>

<p>&hellip;
export PUSHER_URL=<a href="http://asdfa@api.pusherapp.com">http://asdfa@api.pusherapp.com</a>
```</p>

<p><em>Note: If you choose not to set ENV variables on the host system, you can
easily mimic the development environment and drop the <code>config/application.yml</code>
file on to the system. This is no different than using a <code>database.yml</code> that
most Rails developers are used to.</em></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! So with 7 lines of code and a configuration file, you have yourself
an environment configuration setup that&rsquo;s flexible for most deployment
solutions.</p>

</p>

<p>Hope you had a great weekend!</p>

<p>Aside from hibernating inside due to the 6 extra inches of snow that wasn&rsquo;t
predicted, I spent some time with the course content this weekend. In efforts
to do a final proofread, I noticed something wasn&rsquo;t quite right. My goal for
this course was to smooth over the conventions of a Ruby gem that go much less
talked about. However, because I naively chose a gem that included Rails
integration as the example, the content ended up being more about Rails than I
had planned.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I thought about it for a bit on Saturday and decided it was best to
rewrite the content around a simpler gem example. So that my Sunday!</p>

<p>I thought about how I ended up down this path and realized it&rsquo;s because I
didn&rsquo;t put enough planning in to the actual content. Early on, I sketched our a
very rough outline of the lessons in the course, but never thought about the
examples or which gem to use. I originally picked on of my recent written gems
for Rails and assumed it was simple enough that I could quickly gloss over the
Rails details. But the last thing I wanted was for the Rails topics to cloud
the steps need to build a basic Ruby Gem.</p>

<p>Examples are really hard. I ended up choosing a topic that is probably not
supremely useful in an everyday Ruby application, however, the conventions and
theories apply to any gem.</p>

<p>I do plan to cover Rails integration in a future publication. There are so many
hooks in to the framework when using a Railtie, it almost deserves a separate
course. I did save the removed content, so I&rsquo;ll have to figure out where it&rsquo;s
best presented.</p>

<h2>What I Accomplished This Weekend</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, I rewrote the course content around a simpler gem example.
It did simplify the course, so I hope it&rsquo;ll be easier to navigate for those
that are less familiar with Ruby.</p>

<p>I also designed a landing page for the course that I&rsquo;m really excited about.
Web design has always been one of the skills that I&rsquo;ve struggled with. I can generally
get it 70-80% there, but never have it look really polished. I&rsquo;ve spent
more time doing that lately and finally feel like I&rsquo;m hitting the mark.</p>

<p>The only thing left to do is proofread the course content and setup the course
drip campaign in Mailchimp.</p>

<h2>Launch Date</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to announce the course will launch this <strong>Wednesday (12/11) at 7AM
EST</strong>. I&rsquo;ll send an announcement on Wednesday morning with the registration
URL.</p>

<h2>Marketing</h2>

<p>Signups continued to trickle in throughout the weekend and I added another 30
subscriptions to this update list:</p>

<p>The link in Ruby Weekly amounted to 117 newsletter subscription
(<strong>almost 25% of the total visits</strong>). There&rsquo;s been no other channel even close to
that level of conversion.</p>

<p>During the process of posting course updates, I&rsquo;ve come across a few other
channels that I thought would be valuable sources of traffic after launch. I
plan to post to those sites sometime Wednesday and am interested to see how
they do relative to the sources I&rsquo;ve been using.</p>
