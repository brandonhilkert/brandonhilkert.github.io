    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s hard to write a Rails app without interfacing with an external service or
API. In most cases, these services require a secret token or password. Since
checking passwords in to source control is generally a bad practice, we need a
good way to safely and reliably access these values in code.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried a few gems that attempt to make this process easier and ultimately
settled on a simpler solution &ndash; the combination of a few lines of code and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable">ENV variables</a>, which are
accessible whether you manage your own infrastructure or use a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a> service like
<a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>In a recent Rails app, I used <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher</a> and it requires the
unique URL to be setup in an initializer:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>config/initializers/pusher.rb</h1>

<p>Pusher.url = &ldquo;<a href="http://asdfa@api.pusherapp.com">http://asdfa@api.pusherapp.com</a>&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>If I need to set this URL in multiple place &ndash; copying/pasting is not a great
solution because it sets me up for copy/paste errors. It&rsquo;s also a headache to
find all occurrences of the URL when it changes.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>Setup a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">yaml</a> file similar to this:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>config/application.yml</h1>

<p>defaults: &amp;defaults
  PUSHER_URL: <a href="http://asdfa@api.pusherapp.com">http://asdfa@api.pusherapp.com</a></p>

<p>development:
  &lt;&lt;: *defaults</p>

<p>test:
  &lt;&lt;: *defaults
```</p>

<p>Add the following to <code>config/application.rb</code> before the Rails application class
is defined:</p>

<p>```
if File.exists?(File.expand_path(&lsquo;../application.yml&rsquo;, <strong>FILE</strong>))
  config = YAML.load(File.read(File.expand_path(&lsquo;../application.yml&rsquo;, <strong>FILE</strong>)))
  config.merge! config.fetch(Rails.env, {})
  config.each do |key, value|</p>

<pre><code>ENV[key] ||= value.to_s unless value.kind_of? Hash
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Resulting in a <code>config/application.rb</code> that looks something like this:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>config/application.rb</h1>

<p>require File.expand_path(&lsquo;../boot&rsquo;, <strong>FILE</strong>)</p>

<p>require &lsquo;rails/all&rsquo;</p>

<h1>Require the gems listed in Gemfile, including any gems</h1>

<h1>you&rsquo;ve limited to :test, :development, or :production.</h1>

<p>Bundler.require(:default, Rails.env)</p>

<p>if File.exists?(File.expand_path(&lsquo;../application.yml&rsquo;, <strong>FILE</strong>))
  config = YAML.load(File.read(File.expand_path(&lsquo;../application.yml&rsquo;, <strong>FILE</strong>)))
  config.merge! config.fetch(Rails.env, {})
  config.each do |key, value|</p>

<pre><code>ENV[key] ||= value.to_s unless value.kind_of? Hash
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>module NewApp
  class Application &lt; Rails::Application</p>

<pre><code># ...
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The added code first looks for an <code>application.yml</code> file. If it finds one, it
reads in the values for that environment (development, test, production, etc.)
and merges them in to the existing Ruby ENV hash.</p>

<p><em>Note: Since <code>application.yml</code> will typically hold passwords and other secret
keys, it should be added to <code>.gitignore</code> so they don&rsquo;t end up in source
control.</em></p>

<p>Now, when the application is initialized, <code>PUSHER_URL</code> is
available in the ENV hash. This allows me to the update the pusher initializer to:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>config/initializers/pusher.rb</h1>

<p>Pusher.url = ENV[&ldquo;PUSHER_URL&rdquo;]
```</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m deploying to Heroku, I need to set the config value using the following
command:</p>

<p><code>heroku config:set PUSHER_URL=http://asdfa@api.pusherapp.com</code></p>

<p>Or if I&rsquo;m deploying to Ubuntu, I can set the ENV variable for all users on the system:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>/etc/environment</h1>

<p>&hellip;
export PUSHER_URL=<a href="http://asdfa@api.pusherapp.com">http://asdfa@api.pusherapp.com</a>
```</p>

<p><em>Note: If you choose not to set ENV variables on the host system, you can
easily mimic the development environment and drop the <code>config/application.yml</code>
file on to the system. This is no different than using a <code>database.yml</code> that
most Rails developers are used to.</em></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! So with 7 lines of code and a configuration file, you have yourself
an environment configuration setup that&rsquo;s flexible for most deployment
solutions.</p>

</p>

<p>Hope you had a great weekend!</p>

<p>Aside from hibernating inside due to the 6 extra inches of snow that wasn&rsquo;t
predicted, I spent some time with the course content this weekend. In efforts
to do a final proofread, I noticed something wasn&rsquo;t quite right. My goal for
this course was to smooth over the conventions of a Ruby gem that go much less
talked about. However, because I naively chose a gem that included Rails
integration as the example, the content ended up being more about Rails than I
had planned.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I thought about it for a bit on Saturday and decided it was best to
rewrite the content around a simpler gem example. So that my Sunday!</p>

<p>I thought about how I ended up down this path and realized it&rsquo;s because I
didn&rsquo;t put enough planning in to the actual content. Early on, I sketched our a
very rough outline of the lessons in the course, but never thought about the
examples or which gem to use. I originally picked on of my recent written gems
for Rails and assumed it was simple enough that I could quickly gloss over the
Rails details. But the last thing I wanted was for the Rails topics to cloud
the steps need to build a basic Ruby Gem.</p>

<p>Examples are really hard. I ended up choosing a topic that is probably not
supremely useful in an everyday Ruby application, however, the conventions and
theories apply to any gem.</p>

<p>I do plan to cover Rails integration in a future publication. There are so many
hooks in to the framework when using a Railtie, it almost deserves a separate
course. I did save the removed content, so I&rsquo;ll have to figure out where it&rsquo;s
best presented.</p>

<h2>What I Accomplished This Weekend</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, I rewrote the course content around a simpler gem example.
It did simplify the course, so I hope it&rsquo;ll be easier to navigate for those
that are less familiar with Ruby.</p>

<p>I also designed a landing page for the course that I&rsquo;m really excited about.
Web design has always been one of the skills that I&rsquo;ve struggled with. I can generally
get it 70-80% there, but never have it look really polished. I&rsquo;ve spent
more time doing that lately and finally feel like I&rsquo;m hitting the mark.</p>

<p>The only thing left to do is proofread the course content and setup the course
drip campaign in Mailchimp.</p>

<h2>Launch Date</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to announce the course will launch this <strong>Wednesday (12/11) at 7AM
EST</strong>. I&rsquo;ll send an announcement on Wednesday morning with the registration
URL.</p>

<h2>Marketing</h2>

<p>Signups continued to trickle in throughout the weekend and I added another 30
subscriptions to this update list:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/mailchimp-weekend.png" title="&ldquo;Mailchimp Weekend results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>The link in Ruby Weekly amounted to 117 newsletter subscription
(<strong>almost 25% of the total visits</strong>). There&rsquo;s been no other channel even close to
that level of conversion.</p>

<p>During the process of posting course updates, I&rsquo;ve come across a few other
channels that I thought would be valuable sources of traffic after launch. I
plan to post to those sites sometime Wednesday and am interested to see how
they do relative to the sources I&rsquo;ve been using.</p>

</p>

<p>Happy Friday!</p>

<p>This morning I&rsquo;m feeling well rested and finally on the home stretch. In the
middle of the week, the remaining work felt overwhelming at times and I have a
feeling that played in to me feeling exhausted.</p>

<p>Part of it was that each lesson has gotten substantially longer than I planned
for. I think once I get in to the flow of writing, I tend to document
everything for everyone. I don&rsquo;t think everyone will need this level of detail,
but I&rsquo;d hate to leave it out, only to find that some users were left confused
because of the lack thereof.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the word count of each lesson shakes out so far:</p>

<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>Day 1 &ndash; 941</li>
<li>Day 2 &ndash; 1067</li>
<li>Day 3 &ndash; 1738</li>
<li>Day 4 &ndash; 868</li>
<li>Day 5 &ndash; 1118</li>
</ul>


<p>Looking at this now, I&rsquo;ll probably go back and rework Day 3 to either split out
some of the content, or remove it during editing depending on its value.</p>

<h2>What I Accomplished Today</h2>

<p>This morning I finished Day 5 of the Build a Ruby Gem Email Course. I&rsquo;m happy
with where it left off and can now say there&rsquo;s only 1 (2 at most) more to
write. And even those will be more wrap-up. All the code is finished.</p>

<p>I got in to the flow of writing pretty quickly this morning. I naturally woke
up around 6am, so I was probably less in a daze when I started.</p>

<h2>Marketing</h2>

<p>I was looking forward to writing this section&hellip;Yesterday, I opened my inbox and saw this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/ruby-weekly-link.png" title="&ldquo;A link to my Build a Ruby Gem email course in Ruby Weekly.&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s my course link in the <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby Weekly</a> newsletter.
This newsletter is a great weekly summary of the Ruby community and has several
thousand subscribers. I had a feeling this would yield a significant bump in
subscriptions and page views and boy was that true.</p>

<p>Page views were up <strong>153%</strong> from the previous day:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/ga-day5.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics day 5 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>And subscriptions for course updates were up <strong>130%</strong>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/mailchimp-day5.png" title="&ldquo;Mailchimp day 5 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Herein lies the power of reaching your target audience&hellip;</p>

<p>I track conversions to the newsletter in Google Analytics and Ruby Weekly is
kind enough to send a lot a campaign identifier with the link. Here are the
channels that have converted the best:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/ga-conversions-day5.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics traffic conversions from day 5&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>30% of all newsletter clicks resulted in newsletter subscriptions&hellip;I&rsquo;ll take
it! Not far behind is the campaign I sent to my personal list announcing the
email course, and next is links from Twitter. However, what this doesn&rsquo;t show
is that only 7 visitors arrived from Twitter referral links, so while 14% is
pretty good, it&rsquo;s a sample size that&rsquo;s probably not worth trusting.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve read plenty about the power of email, I&rsquo;ve not seen this effect in
person until now. With these quick marketing recaps, I feel like I&rsquo;ve only
scratched the surface. After the course launches, I plan to spend more time
with the numbers to get a better feel for what went well, and more so, what I
should avoid in future launches.</p>

</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tired. Getting up around 5am all week has worn on me. Yesterday I felt like
zombie&hellip;and it was mostly my own fault because I didn&rsquo;t make it a priority to
get bed a decent hour.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about you, but I function best with 7-8 hours of sleep. I
generally can&rsquo;t sleep longer than 8, and anything less than 7 is OK for a
day or two, otherwise, it catches up with me. I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going
on here&hellip;</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Having realized this, I got to sleep last night around 9:30pm. I figured I&rsquo;d
sleep in until 6am or so, but naturally woke up around 5:15am. So while I&rsquo;m
feeling better this morning, I&rsquo;m still feeling the side effects of not getting
enough sleep from the first few days of the week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of this for the rest of the week and see if I can get
back to a normal (whatever that means!).</p>

<h2>What I Accomplished Today</h2>

<p>Like the previous days, I was able to write Day 4 of the Build a Ruby Gem Email
Course. I had a bit of trouble getting in to the flow of writing this morning.
I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s due to the lack of sleep mentioned above, or just a little
speed bump in the normal creative process. It took 15 min. or so until I felt
like words were coming out naturally.</p>

<h2>Changes to the Email Course</h2>

<p>On Day 3, I realized I hadn&rsquo;t gotten to the meat of the Ruby gem and was still
writing about important, but somewhat theoretical topics. It occurred to me that
it&rsquo;s probably best not to cut the content, but rather, extend the course. So
instead of a 5-day course, it might be 6 or 7. My goal is write the best content possible and if after 7 days, I
feel like I&rsquo;ve covered the topic thoroughly, I&rsquo;ll wrap it up.</p>

<p>One thought that has crossed my mind is removing some of the content for an
ebook. I could make the course somewhat abbreviated, while offering the book as
an up-sell to those interested in the details. I&rsquo;ll think about this some more
and once the course content shakes out.</p>

<p>Additionally , I thinking about spreading the course out. So rather than
send 1 email a day, shoot for every 2-3 days, so that I can market the course as
a 14 or 21-day email course. I also feel like the people that will get the most
value out of the content  would benefit from extra time in between each lesson.</p>

<h2>Marketing</h2>

<p>Visits were slightly down yesterday, and I suspect the allure of the announcement has worn off.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/ga-day4.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics day 4 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Thinking more about it, I&rsquo;ve not been great at seeking out marketing channels
for people that might be a good fit for the course. I&rsquo;ve been posting to the
same channels, which has produced a decreasing level of interest over the past
4 days. Truthfully, I&rsquo;m pretty worn out by the time I finish the email course
lesson and this update post, so it&rsquo;s difficult to get worked up for that. But
I&rsquo;ll think more about it and report back.</p>

<p>The mailing list is up to 82 subscribers, so while the growth is slowing, it&rsquo;s
still a 10% lift over the previous day. This, too, probably reiterates my need
to find users elsewhere.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/mailchimp-day4.png" title="&ldquo;Mailchimp day 4 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>I setup the subscription form to track what page the user was on when they
subscribed. Subscriptions are coming from all over the place. It appears that even after 4 days, people are
still landing on the first post of the series and converting.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/mailchimp-conversion-sources-day4.png" title="&ldquo;Mailchimp conversion sources for day 4&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Again, Reddit appears to be the best source for both traffic and conversions.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/sources-day4.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics day 4 traffic sources&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Once the email course is live, I&rsquo;ll make a better effort to market the landing
page elsewhere. I think these updates may be better suited for a different
target audience anyway.</p>

<p>The end is near!</p>

</p>

<p>I let myself sleep in until 5:30am this morning ;) I spent a few very
unsuccessful hours wrestling with Wordpress last night and didn&rsquo;t get to bed at
the time I wanted. However, all is well. I was able to push out Day 4 of the
Build a Ruby Gem Email Course without issue.</p>

<p>One of the things that I&rsquo;m noticing about putting the course posts together is
how much the content relies on outside resources. Whether it&rsquo;s an external URL,
the output of a command prompt, or a diff on Github&hellip;getting those together is
a non-trivial amount of time.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>A side effect of getting up early is that by 7:30am (when I&rsquo;ve typically finish
this post), I feel really productive. At this point, I&rsquo;ve worked for 2 straight
hours, all of which have been highly focused. So at 7:30am, I take a break, get
some breakfast and take a shower and &ldquo;start&rdquo; the rest of my day. It feels like
the day starts out on a better foot as a result.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also found that I&rsquo;ve been able to focus better early in the morning vs.
later at night. I know this is personal thing, some people do their best work
in the wee hours of the night. Not me, I&rsquo;m a morning person and have embraced
it. My productivity in the morning is probably 2-3x that of my normal
productivity during the day. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m refreshed or
fewer distractions (it&rsquo;s dark, no TV, no social media, no other windows
open&hellip;).</p>

<h2>What I Accomplished Today</h2>

<p>I pushed out the latest day of the email course. I feel like it&rsquo;s just starting
to get in to the thick of things. I&rsquo;ve been really sensitive to the fact that
not every person that takes the course will be a Ruby veteran. Hopefully the
detailed discussions on load paths and basic installations won&rsquo;t detract from
the value for those that are.</p>

<p>Yesterday I mentioned the non-optimal formatting of my email campaigns on
mobile devices. I spent some time with Mailchimp last night and applied a more
responsive template to the campaign. It&rsquo;s better, but still somewhat finicky in
the iOS Gmail app. I&rsquo;ve sent a support request and hopefully I&rsquo;ll have that
ironed out soon. But for those on every other platform, you should&rsquo;ve had a
much better reading experience!</p>

<h2>Marketing</h2>

<p>As I expected, the growth of both the mailing list and page views slowed down a bit.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/ga-day3.png" title="&ldquo;Google Analytics day 3 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>I got a 15% bump in mailing list subscriptions, which is better than nothing!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/woh/mailchimp-day3.png" title="&ldquo;Mailchimp day 3 results&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sending the daily update campaigns at 8pm. I didn&rsquo;t put much thought in to
this time, other than the fact that I stumbled on an email marketing post that
suggested the hours between 8-12am get the best open rates. According to the
campaign report, the open rate is doing well, as compared with the average.
However, I have a tendency to believe it&rsquo;s more due to the nature of the
opted-in target audience. This is a very specific topic that people
specifically wanted to read about. So it makes sense to me that the open rate
would be pretty high.</p>
