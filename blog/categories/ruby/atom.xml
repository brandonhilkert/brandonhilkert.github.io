    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This article was originally posted on the <a href="http://plumbing.pipelinedeals.com/">PipelineDeals Engineering
Blog</a></em></p>

<p>The PipelineDeals web application recently celebrated its ninth birthday. It&rsquo;s
seen its fair share of developers, all of whom had their own idea of &ldquo;clean
code&rdquo;. As a team, we&rsquo;d been brainstorming ways to wrangle certain areas of the
application. The question we&rsquo;d frequently ask ourselves was <em>&ldquo;How do we clean
up [x] (some neglected feature of the application)?</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Reasonable solutions ended up being:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rewrite it</li>
<li>Rewrite and put it elsewhere</li>
</ol>


<p>In short, we chose to rewrite many of the hairy areas of the app into separate services communicating over HTTP. It&rsquo;s been about a year since our first commit in a separate service, and we&rsquo;ve learned quite a bit since then. This is part 1 in a series of posts related to our transition to microservices.</p>

<h2>How we got here</h2>

<p>This was us 18 months ago. PipelineDeals was a crufty Rails 2 application that many of us were scared to open. It&rsquo;d been several years of adding feature upon feature without consistent knowledge, style, or guidance. And it&rsquo;s probably not surprising we had what we did. Regardless, we needed to fix it.</p>

<p>One of our goals was to move to Rails 3, and later more updated versions, but in order to get there, we had to refactor (or remove) quite a bit of code to make the transition easier.</p>

<p>This, to me, was a huge factor around our decision to move to a more service-focused approach. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJVTM7mE1Cc">At this year&rsquo;s Railsconf keynote</a>, DHH joked about the &ldquo;majestic monolith&rdquo; and how many companies prematurely piece out services, all to later suffer pain when they realize it was a premature optimization.</p>

<p>The same could be said for our move. Instead of spinning out separate services, we could have cleaned up the mess we had by refactoring every nasty piece of our app. We could have turned our ugly monolith into a majestic one. But while it would&rsquo;ve been possible, our team agreed we were better served by more or less starting over. Not in the big-bang rewrite sense, but instead to stand up brand new service apps when we added new features, and when it made sense. &ldquo;Made sense&rdquo; is the key here. There have been many times when it didn&rsquo;t make sense over the past 12 months. But we&rsquo;re learning and getting better at identifying the things that are good candidates for a more isolated service.</p>

<h2>Now what?</h2>

<p><em>Do we wait for the next requested feature or what?</em></p>

<p>At one of our weekly team hangouts, we watched a talk focused on starting by isolating the responsibility of Email. It was the perfect introduction and motivation for us to get a small win and some experience under our belts. For some reason prior, we didn&rsquo;t have a great sense of how to start making that transition.</p>

<p>The idea was to take our emails (and there were plenty) and move them to a separate Rails app that&rsquo;s only responsibilty is sending email. While it sounds trivial, the idea alone introduces a lot of interesting questions: <em>What do we do with those really nasty emails that have 30 instance variables? What do we do if the email service is down? How do we trigger an email to be sent?</em></p>

<h2>Rails new</h2>

<p>We created a new Rails 4 app, removed all the stuff we didn&rsquo;t need and created a golden shrine where emails could flourish&hellip;but seriously, that&rsquo;s all it did. And it did it really well.</p>

<p>The next question was how to send emails from the main application. We&rsquo;re very happy <a href="http://sidekiq.org/pro/">Sidekiq Pro</a> users, and one of the benefits we love about Sidekiq is the built-in retries. This gives us a layer of reliability outside of the code layer. So rather than build some ad-hoc retry mechanism by creating a counter in ruby, and rescuing failures within a certain range, we shoot off a job. If it fails because the network is down, or the endpoint isn&rsquo;t available, the job will retry soon after and continue down the happy path. Sidekiq retries are a recurring theme with our infrastructure. We&rsquo;ve made a number of decisions around the fact that we have this advantage already built-in, and we might as well take advantage of it. More on that to come.</p>

<h2>Communicate</h2>

<p>The defacto communication method between services is over HTTP. And we did nothing different. Our services use JSON payloads to exchange data, which let&rsquo;s us easily take advantage of Sidekiq on both ends.</p>

<p>So now, rather than invoking a built-in Rails mailer like:</p>

<p><code>
UserMailer.welcome(current_user).deliver
</code></p>

<p>we invoke a PORO to send off the communication:</p>

<p><code>
Email.to current_user, :user_welcome
</code></p>

<p>where <code>Email</code> is defined as</p>

<p>```
class Email
  def initialize(users, email_key, opts)</p>

<pre><code>@users, @email_key, @opts = users, email_key, opts
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def self.to(users, email_key, opts = {})</p>

<pre><code>new(users, email_key, opts).queue_email
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def queue_email</p>

<pre><code>opts[:email_key] = email_key
opts[:to] ||= email_array
opts[:name] ||= first_users_name
opts[:user_id] ||= user_id
opts[:account_id] ||= account_id

json = JSON.generate(opts)
RestClient.post(ENV["PIPELINE_EMAIL_URL"], json, :content_type =&gt; :json)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>There&rsquo;re a number of use-case specific variables above, but the <code>email_key</code> is probably the most important. We used that to describe what email should be invoked on the service.</p>

<p>In the above example, we triggered the <code>welcome</code> email on the <code>UserMailer</code> class. We translated this request into an email key of <code>user_welcome</code>.</p>

<p>This key then gets interpreted by the Email service app and turned into an actual <code>Mailer</code> class and method within it. We could have done this in a variety of ways, but we split the string on the service-side at the <code>_</code>, and the first element described the mailer, the rest the method. So in this case, it gets interpreted as <code>UserMailer#welcome</code>.</p>

<p>One thing this pattern allowed us to do was almost full copy/paste the old mailer methods in to the new Email service application.</p>

<h2>Failures, failures, failures</h2>

<p>&ldquo;What if the service is down?&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;the email request will fail!&rdquo; Sure will.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s wrap that request in a Sidekiq job to take advantage of the built-in retries.</p>

<p>Rather than invoke the following method in the email object:</p>

<p><code>
RestClient.post(ENV["PIPELINE_EMAIL_URL"], json, :content_type =&gt; :json)
</code></p>

<p>we&rsquo;ll shoot off a Sidekiq job instead, changing the <code>queue_email</code> method to:</p>

<p>```
def queue_email
  opts[:email_key] = email_key
  opts[:to] ||= email_array
  opts[:name] ||= first_users_name
  opts[:user_id] ||= user_id
  opts[:account_id] ||= account_id</p>

<p>  EmailWorker.perform_async(opts)
end
```</p>

<p>There we have it. Network-proof email requests!</p>

<p>Not so fast&hellip;</p>

<p>Astute readers will probably recognize that the service-side network communication can potentially also fail. This is becoming a pattern, huh? More communication, more potential for failure and more potential headaches.</p>

<p>On the <strong>service side</strong>, we have a controller that takes in the request for the email and immediately serializes it to a Sidekiq job:</p>

<p>```
  def create</p>

<pre><code>EmailWorker.perform_async(parsed_params)
head :accepted
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  private</p>

<p>  def parse_params</p>

<pre><code>JSON.parse(request.body) || {}
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Because we immediately serialize the job to Sidekiq, we&rsquo;ve successfully acknowledged the job was received, and the main app&rsquo;s Sidekiq job completes successfully. Now the email service can move on to doing the heavy-lifting in whatever way makes the most sense. In our case, we use Mailgun to send our emails, so the <code>EmailWorker</code> Sidekiq job invokes a new mailer based on the <code>email_key</code> param and sends it off to mailgun for transport. And because it&rsquo;s wrapped in a Sidekiq job, we can sleep well knowing that the Mailgun request can fail and the job will successfully retry until it goes through.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Service communication is definitely not for the faint of heart and as a team, we can completely appreciate the challenges that come along with keeping services in sync now&mdash;especially having stood up about 8 new services in the last 12 months.</p>

<p>Sidekiq has been the queueing solution we&rsquo;ve leaned on to keep communication in sync and reliable. We&rsquo;ve also written a few internal tools that piggy-backy off Sidekiq that we&rsquo;re really excited share with the community in the near future.</p>

<p>Part II, in this series, will discuss the methods of communication necessary to consider when implementing a service-based architecture.</p>

    <link href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/organizing-javascript-in-rails-application-with-turbolinks/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-30T16:10:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/organizing-javascript-in-rails-application-with-turbolinks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to escape Javascript in a Rails application. From a tiny script to a full-on Javascript framework, websites are becoming more and more reliant on Javascript, whether we like it or not.</p>

<p>Several articles back, I documented <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/page-specific-javascript-in-rails/">how I handle page-specific Javascript in a Rails application</a>. My solution included a third-party jQuery plugin that did some magic on the <code>$(document).ready</code> function in combination with CSS style scoping to limit the functionality.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The plugin worked well for awhile, but with the advent of Turbolinks, the
solution felt less and less appropriate. I&rsquo;ve since settled on some techniques
to not only handle page-specific Javascript, but overall organization and structure of Javascript within a Rails application. I&rsquo;ve used it in a hand full of large applications over the past few months and it&rsquo;s held up incredibly well.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Using &ldquo;sprinkles&rdquo; of Javascript throughout a Rails application can get unwieldly fast if we&rsquo;re not consistent. What we ideally want is some techniques and guidelines that can keep the Javascript organized in our projects. <strong>We also don&rsquo;t want to have to disable Turbolinks to make our application work as we expect</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>Generally, javascript behavior can be boiled down to the following categories:</p>

<ol>
<li>Behavior that&rsquo;s &ldquo;always on&rdquo;</li>
<li>Behavior that&rsquo;s triggered from a user action</li>
</ol>


<p>But first, a few things to will help us stay organized&hellip;</p>

<h2>Class Scoping</h2>

<p>I still like to scope the body element of the layout(s) with the controller and action name:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;body class="&lt;%= controller_name %&gt; &lt;%= action_name %&gt;"&gt;
  &lt;%= yield %&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></p>

<p>This not only let&rsquo;s us control access to the DOM through jQuery if we need to, but also provides some top-level styling classes to allow us to easily add page-specific CSS.</p>

<p>In the case we&rsquo;re working on the proverbial blog posts application, the body tag ends up looking like:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;body class="posts index"&gt;
  &lt;%= yield %&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></p>

<p>This gives us the opportunity to scope CSS and Javascripts to all <code>posts</code>-related pages in the controller with the <code>.posts</code> class, or down to the specific page using a combination of both the controller and action: <code>.posts.index</code>.</p>

<h2>Default Application Manifest</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the default <code>app/assets/javascripts/application.js</code>:</p>

<p><code>
// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file.
//
// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.
//
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .
</code></p>

<p>I start by removing the line <code>//= require_tree .</code>. I do this because if you don&rsquo;t, the javascript files in the folder will be loaded in alphabetical order. As you&rsquo;ll see below, there&rsquo;s an initialization file that needs to be loaded before other Javascript. We&rsquo;ll also remove the comments from the top of the file to preserve space.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;re left with:</p>

<p><code>
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
</code></p>

<h2>Initialization</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by adding the file <code>app/assets/javascripts/init.coffee</code> with the following:</p>

<p>```
window.App ||= {}</p>

<p>App.init = &ndash;>
  $(&ldquo;a, span, i, div&rdquo;).tooltip()</p>

<p>$(document).on &ldquo;page:change&rdquo;, &ndash;>
  App.init()
```</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dig in to each pagef of this:</p>

<p><code>
window.App ||= {}
</code></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re creating the <code>App</code> object on window so the functionality added to the object is available throughout the application.</p>

<p>Next, we define an <code>init()</code> function on <code>App</code> to initialize common jQuery plugins and other Javascript libraries:</p>

<p><code>
App.init = -&gt;
  $("a, span, i, div").tooltip()
</code></p>

<p>The call to <code>$("a, span, i, div").tooltip()</code> initializes Bootstrap Tooltips. This is an example of the type of libraries that can/should be setup here. Obviously, if you&rsquo;re not using Bootstrap tooltips, you would haven&rsquo;t this here, but coupled with the next line, we&rsquo;ll see why this works.</p>

<p>As many have found out the hard way, <strong>when Turbolinks is enabled</strong> in a project, jQuery <code>$(document).ready</code> functions <strong>don&rsquo;t get fired from page to page</strong>. In order to call the <code>init()</code> function on each page transition, we&rsquo;ll hook in to the <code>page:change</code> event:</p>

<p><code>
$(document).on "page:change", -&gt;
  App.init()
</code>
<em>Note: the <code>page:change</code> transition is also triggered on the well known document ready event, so there&rsquo;s no need to add any special handling for first page load.</em></p>

<p>Lastly, we need to add <code>init.coffee</code> to the asset pipeline:</p>

<p><code>
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require init
</code></p>

<h2>&ldquo;Always On&rdquo; Javascript Functionality</h2>

<p>Now with the defaults out of the way, let&rsquo;s take a look at adding some behavior.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume one of our pages will show a Javascript graph of data. We&rsquo;ll start by adding a file with a name related to that responsibility.</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>app/assets/javascripts/app.chart.coffee</h1>

<p>class App.Chart
  constructor: (@el) &ndash;></p>

<pre><code># intialize some stuff
</code></pre>

<p>  render: &ndash;></p>

<pre><code># do some stuff
</code></pre>

<p>$(document).on &ldquo;page:change&rdquo;, &ndash;>
  chart = new App.Chart $(&ldquo;#chart&rdquo;)
  chart.render()</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>A few things to note here&hellip;</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>I created a class in the <code>App</code> namespace &mdash; the same we initialized in <code>app/assets/javascripts/init.coffee</code>. This gives us an isolated class that has a clear responsiblity. Like our Ruby, we want to do our best to keep its responsibilities to a minimium.</p>

<p>You might notice the file takes the form:</p>

<p>```
|
|
class definition
|
|</p>

<p>|
invocation
|
```</p>

<p>While this may seem obvious, it&rsquo;s an important point to keep in mind. I&rsquo;ve found it offers a predictable structure that allows me to open any coffeescript file that we&rsquo;ve written in the project and generally know where to look for what.</p>

<h3>Turbolinks-Proof</h3>

<p>We called this &ldquo;Always On&rdquo; functionality because, as you probably noticed, using the following event listener <code>$(document).on "page:change", -&gt;</code>, we know with Turbolinks, this gets triggered on every page transition.</p>

<h3>Add to Manifest</h3>

<p>Because we removed the <code>//= require_tree .</code> line in the default <code>application.js</code> manifest file, we&rsquo;ll have to add our chart file to be included in the asset pipeline (last line):</p>

<p><code>
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require init
//= require app.chart
</code></p>

<h3>Page-Specific Javascript</h3>

<p>Uh oh, so maybe we don&rsquo;t want the graph to show up on every page! In this case, we&rsquo;re looking for &ldquo;Always On&rdquo; functionality for specific pages <strong>ONLY</strong>.</p>

<p>We can limit the page pages certain functionality is loaded on by using the classes we added to the body of the layout. In this case, a small conditional to the invocation can prevent this being triggered on pages it shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>

<p><code>
$(document).on "page:change", -&gt;
  return unless $(".posts.index").length &gt; 0
  f = new App.Chart $("#chart")
  f.render()
</code></p>

<p>We added <code>return unless $(".posts.index").length &gt; 0</code> to make sure <code>App.Chart</code> never gets instantiated if we&rsquo;re on the <code>.posts.index</code> page. While this may seem verbose, I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s not very common to need page-specific functionality. There are probably plenty of libraries that do something similar, like <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/page-specific-javascript-in-rails/">the one I previously suggested</a>. <strong>However, to me, limiting javascript to a single page and very explicit when I read the code, it&rsquo;s almost never worth dragging in a separate plugin for this. YMMV.</strong></p>

<h2>User-Triggered Javascript</h2>

<p>This type of Javascript is exactly what you&rsquo;d think &mdash; Javascript invoked as a result of a user clicking or performing some type of action. You&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;I know how to do this, I&rsquo;ll just add a random file to the javascripts directory and throw in some jQuery&rdquo;. While this will functionally work just fine, I&rsquo;ve found that keeping the structure of these files similar will give you great piece of mind going forward.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;data-behavior&rdquo; Attribute</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume there&rsquo;s a link in the user&rsquo;s account that allows them to update their credit card. In this case, we have the following:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;%= link_to "Update Credit Card", "#", data: { behavior: "update-credit-card" } %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll probably notice the <code>data-behavior</code> tag being added to the link. This is the key we&rsquo;ll use to attach the Javascript behavior.</p>

<p>We could have added a unique class to the link:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;%= link_to "Update Credit Card", "#", class: "update-credit-card" %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>or, perhaps, even assign an ID:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;%= link_to "Update Credit Card", "#", id: "update-credit-card" %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Both of these techniques don&rsquo;t really indicate whether we added the <code>update-card-card</code> for the use of CSS styling, or to attach Javascript behavior. So in my applications, I leave classes for <strong>styling ONLY</strong>.</p>

<p>So now to the Javascript:</p>

<p>```
App.Billing =
  update: &ndash;></p>

<pre><code># do some stuff
</code></pre>

<p>$(document).on &ldquo;click&rdquo;, &ldquo;[data-behavior~=update-credit-card]&rdquo;, =>
  App.Billing.update()
```</p>

<p>We can use the selector <code>[data-behavior~=update-credit-card]</code> to latch on to the <code>data-behavior</code> tag we defined in the view. We use the <code>on</code> jQuery method to ensure that we&rsquo;re listening to this event whether the element&rsquo;s on the page or not. This is what allows us to load this Javascript when on other pages and have it still work when a user clicks through to the page with the actual link on it.</p>

<p>We could latch on to the <code>change</code> event, or whatever is appropriate to the element we&rsquo;re adding behavior.</p>

<h3>Add to Manifest</h3>

<p>Again, because Javascripts assets we add to <code>app/assets/javascripts</code> won&rsquo;t automatically be inserted in to the asset pipeline, we&rsquo;ll add <code>//= require app.billing</code> to the manifest file:</p>

<p><code>
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require init
//= require app.chart
//= require app.billing
</code></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Using the techniques above, we can keep the Javascript in our Rails applications organized and predictable. We can rest easy knowing the files will all generally look the same. There&rsquo;s not been any uses cases where this structure hasn&rsquo;t worked for me personally.</p>

<p>One thing that makes me feel good about this approach is there&rsquo;s no real magic or extra plugins. It&rsquo;s using all the tools we already have in a basic Rails application, which is one less thing to maintain and keep up to date. Less depedencies == less pain down the road.</p>

    <updated>2015-05-06T06:03:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/how-to-start-with-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In light of RailsConf last month, I spent some time thinking about my experience learning Ruby and Rails back in 2009. The conference included quite a few seasoned veterans, but like any popular technology, there was also plenty of people that either just started learning Rails, or are considering doing so in the near future.</p>

<p>Turning the clocks back to when you knew much less about something is hard. But putting yourself back in that position can offer valuable insight to the opportunities available and how they might be improved in the future.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>How I Started</h2>

<p>Most come to the Rails community not knowing much about Ruby. Learning any new technology is hard. And learning a few at the same time is even harder.</p>

<p>This was me in 2009. A relatively new Rails 2.3 app was dropped in to my lap, and despite only having experience with PHP, my job was to aggressively ship new features. I read Agile Web Development with Rails cover to cover and dove in head first. Little did I know it would be one of the best career decisions of my life.</p>

<p>I spent the next few months pounding my head against my desk. The days and weeks of frustration seemed endless. And then&hellip;it just went away. The pain I&rsquo;d endured merged in to an intense desire to dig in harder.  There were more light bulbs moments in the months that followed than any other time I can remember.</p>

<p>During those intense months of frustration, I leaned heavily on the Rails and Philly.rb IRC rooms. In the former, I tried not to say anything too stupid. Fortunately, the latter felt more welcoming and approachable and I owe that group a lot of holding my hand through what might have otherwise been a deathwish for me and the Ruby language.</p>

<p>A few questions pop out in my head&hellip;I was confused about filtering an ActiveRecord query and was surprised to learn methods that were built in to the Ruby language would do exactly what I want. At the time, if it wasn&rsquo;t in ActiveRecord, it might as well have not existed to me.</p>

<p>From someone who <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/7-reasons-why-im-sticking-with-minitest-and-fixtures-in-rails/">advocates for using tools without fancy DSL&rsquo;s</a>, this is hysterical to me. Ruby, of all things, had the answer. At that point, I&rsquo;m almost certain I&rsquo;d never seen the Ruby standard library documentation.</p>

<h2>Rails Starts Where Ruby Stops</h2>

<p>Out of convenience, Rails does a lot to make our experience with the Ruby language easier than it is out of the box. Like <code>2.hours.ago</code>&hellip;.none of this is possible if Rails doesn&rsquo;t <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Integer.html">monkey patch the <code>Integer</code> class</a>. For someone who doesn&rsquo;t know any better (me in 2009!), being able to calls <code>#hours</code> on an integer just seems like something the language would do. Because Ruby was created for developer happiness, right?</p>

<p>So perhaps the approach of monkey patching doesn&rsquo;t offer a clear indication of where functionality is coming from. The flip side of that argument is convenience. If I had to instantiate a time-related class every time I wanted &ldquo;noon time yesterday&rdquo;, maybe I&rsquo;d be slightly less enthralled with my ability to get stuff done in Rails. Perhaps it would cater more to the true OO neckbeards, but also may have resulted in far less adoption. Who knows!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have strong numbers to back this up, but I&rsquo;m guessing large majority of developers that get paid to write Ruby, due so within the context of a Rails application. And whether we want to admit it or not, a large reason new developers learn Ruby, is to learn Rails. So does it matter that newcomers don&rsquo;t know Ruby?</p>

<p>From the standpoint of creating a web application fast and being able to iterate quickly, maybe not. But certainly if the person is interested in understanding the interworkings of what&rsquo;s happening within the application, knowing where Ruby stops and Rails starts is ideal.</p>

<h2>How to Start?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to quite a few people that are new to Ruby and I always struggle to suggest a good start project when they ask.  Everyone learns differently and has different interests, but in general, I think there are core-level motivating factors that can keep someone focused and interested.</p>

<p>To me, it&rsquo;s the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does the project have real-world value?</li>
<li>Does the project offer immediate feedback?</li>
</ol>


<p>Why does it matter if the project has real-world value? For one, continuing on something that doesn&rsquo;t improve our lives is sometimes hard to keep up with. And learning Ruby/Rails is definitely something that&rsquo;ll take more than a few nights and weekends. If the project we&rsquo;re driving towards continues to seem desirable, we&rsquo;ll have a better chance not to lose focus.</p>

<p>Second, I don&rsquo;t want to get too philosophical, but there are plenty of resources that suggest if you want something badly enough and can visualize the end goal, there&rsquo;s a higher likelyhood that it&rsquo;ll come to be. Our desires will be stronger when we can see the end goal and know there is an increased real-world value for this application to be in existence.</p>

<p>The immediate feedback piece shortens the time we&rsquo;re able to see changes and progress. This brings a lower rate of abandonment and better chance we&rsquo;ll see the project through.</p>

<p>Rails answers both of these questions with a resounding, &ldquo;<strong>YES!</strong>&rdquo;. Think about it&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Does a Rails application have real world value?</strong> Of course it does. It&rsquo;s a web application. There has been no better time to be focused on Rails, where it be for the web and the backend of a mobile app.</p>

<p><strong>Does the project offer immediate feedback?</strong> Sure does! A couple keystrokes and a refresh can give you instant gratifcation in the browser (or the occasional disappointment!).</p>

<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a command-line tool, game, or other utility, I struggle to find other oppotunities to get people started. Frankly, many newcomers to Rails have never used a terminal before. So why would we suggest a command-line application as a good place to start? This is especially true for someone with little programming experience.</p>

<p>For the experienced developer, it&rsquo;d be much easier to suggest writing something like a markdown processor, but only because they have the context of another language. At that point, they&rsquo;re really just comparing the Ruby language to what they already know and figuring out how to translate the things they <em>do</em> know to Ruby.</p>

<p>For a new developer altogether, they would get little value of writing a markdown processor, and in fact, probably seems more like a research project than a sure-fire way to learn a developer-friendly programming language.</p>

<p>So now we&rsquo;re back to suggesting Rails, but then you consider everything else a newcomer would need familiarity with to traverse the Rails eco-stytem: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Coffeescript, Sass, SQL&hellip;</p>

<p>The list goes on and on. Not so easy after all. No wonder people get intimidated and bail. I suppose there&rsquo;s starting with Sinatra, but the doesn&rsquo;t remove you from the HTML and CSS requirements. Perhaps those impossible to dodge, given the medium. And even with Sinatra, we often end up creating the functionality that&rsquo;s in Rails anyway.</p>

<p>I wish I had a better answer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/using-the-sucker-punch-ruby-gem-to-cache-stripe-data-in-rails/">last article</a>, I presented some code that wrapped up accessing a customer&rsquo;s Stripe data and added a caching layer on top. I wanted to take some time to dig in to that code and see how we can make it better.</p>

<p>Decorators give us a tool to add additional functionality to a class while still keeping the public API consistent. From the perspective of the client, this is a win-win! Not only do they get the added behavior, but they don&rsquo;t need to call different methods to do so.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Our original class accessed data from Stripe <strong>AND</strong> cached the response for some time period. I accentuated &ldquo;AND&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s generally the word to be on alert for when considering whether functionality can be teased apart in to separate responsibilities.</p>

<p>The question becomes, can we make one class that accesses Stripe data, and another that&rsquo;s only responsible for caching it?</p>

<p>Of course we can!</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the most basic form of accessing our Stripe customer data with the <a href="https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby">Stripe gem</a>:</p>

<p>```
class AccountsController &lt; ApplicationController
  before_action :require_authentication</p>

<p>  def show</p>

<pre><code>@customer = Stripe::Customer.retrieve(current_user.stripe_id)
@invoices = @customer.invoices
@upcoming_invoice = @customer.upcoming_invoice
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h2>Extract an Adapter</h2>

<p>Because we&rsquo;re interfacing with a third-party system (Stripe), it makes sense for to create a local adapter to access the Stripe methods. It&rsquo;s probably not likely we&rsquo;re going to switch out the official Stripe gem for another one that access the same data, but a better argument might be that we could switch billing systems entirely in the future. And if we make a more generic adapter to our third-party billing system, we would only need to update our adapter when that time comes.</p>

<p>While the adapter optimization may seem like overkill here, we&rsquo;ll see how that generic adapter helps us implement our caching layer shortly.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by removing the notion that it&rsquo;s Stripe and all and call it <code>Billing</code>. Here we can expose the methods needed from the  <code>AccountsController</code> above:</p>

<p>```
class Billing
  attr_reader :billing_id</p>

<p>  def initialize(billing_id)</p>

<pre><code>@billing_id = billing_id
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def customer</p>

<pre><code>Stripe::Customer.retrieve(billing_id)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def invoices</p>

<pre><code>customer.invoices
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def upcoming_invoice</p>

<pre><code>customer.upcoming_invoice
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>There we have it. A simple <code>Billing</code> class that wraps the methods that we used in the first place &mdash; no change in functionality. But certainly more organized and isolated.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s now use this new class in the accounts controller from earlier:</p>

<p>```
class AccountsController &lt; ApplicationController
  before_action :require_authentication</p>

<p>  def show</p>

<pre><code>billing = Billing.new(current_user.stripe_id)

@customer = billing.customer
@invoices = billing.invoices
@upcoming_invoice = billing.upcoming_invoice
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Not too bad! At this point we&rsquo;ve provide the exact same functionality we had before, but we have a class that sits in the middle between the controller and Stripe gem &ndash; an adapter if you will.</p>

<h2>Create a Decorator</h2>

<p>Now that we have our adapter set up, let&rsquo;s look at how we can add caching behavior to improve the performance of our accounts page.</p>

<p>The most of basic form of a decorator is to pass in the object we&rsquo;re decorating (<code>Billing</code>), and define the same methods of the billing, but add the additional functionality on top of them.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s create a base form of  <code>BillingWithCache</code> that <strong>does nothing more</strong> than call the host methods:</p>

<p>```
class BillingWithCache
  def initialize(billing_service)</p>

<pre><code>@billing_service = billing_service
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def customer</p>

<pre><code>billing_service.customer
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def invoices</p>

<pre><code>customer.invoices
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def upcoming_invoice</p>

<pre><code>customer.upcoming_invoice
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  private</p>

<p>  attr_reader :billing_service
end
```</p>

<p>So while we haven&rsquo;t added any additional functionality, we have created the ability for this class to be used in place of our existing <code>Billing</code> class because it responds to the same API (<code>#customer</code>, <code>#invoices</code>, <code>#upcoming_invoice</code>).</p>

<p>Integrating this new class with <code>AccountsController</code> looks like:</p>

<p>```
class AccountsController &lt; ApplicationController
  before_action :require_authentication</p>

<p>  def show</p>

<pre><code>billing = BillingWithCache.new(Billing.new(current_user.stripe_id))

@customer = billing.customer
@invoices = billing.invoices
@upcoming_invoice = billing.upcoming_invoice
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>As you can see, we only had to change one line &mdash; the line where we decorated the original billing class:</p>

<p><code>
BillingWithCache.new(Billing.new(current_user.stripe_id))
</code></p>

<p>I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t actually cache anything!&rdquo;. You&rsquo;re right! Let&rsquo;s dig in to the <code>BillingWithCache</code> class and add that.</p>

<h2>Adding Caching Functionality</h2>

<p>In order to cache data using <code>Rails.cache</code>, we&rsquo;re going to need a cache key of some kind. Fortunately, the original <code>Billing</code> class provides a reader for <code>billing_id</code> that will allow us to make this unique to that user.</p>

<p><code>
def cache_key(item)
  "user/#{billing_id}/billing/#{item}"
end
</code></p>

<p>In this case, <code>item</code> can refer to things like <code>"customer"</code>, <code>"invoices"</code>, or <code>"upcoming_invoice"</code>. This gives us a method we can use internally with <code>BillingWithCache</code> to provide a cache key unique to the both the user and the type of data we&rsquo;re caching.</p>

<p>Adding in the calls to actually cache the data:</p>

<p>```
class BillingWithCache
  def initialize(billing_service)</p>

<pre><code>@billing_service = billing_service
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def customer</p>

<pre><code>key = cache_key("customer")

Rails.cache.fetch(key, expires: 15.minutes) do
  billing_service.customer
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def invoices</p>

<pre><code>key = cache_key("invoices")

Rails.cache.fetch(key, expires: 15.minutes) do
  customer.invoices
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def upcoming_invoice</p>

<pre><code>key = cache_key("upcoming_invoice")

Rails.cache.fetch(key, expires: 15.minutes) do
  customer.upcoming_invoice
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  private</p>

<p>  attr_reader :billing_service</p>

<p>  def cache_key(item)</p>

<pre><code>"user/#{billing_service.billing_id}/billing/#{item}"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The code above caches the call to each of these methods for 15 minutes. We could go further and move that to an argument with a default value, but I&rsquo;ll leave as an exercise for another time.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Separating your application and third-party services helps keeps your applications flexible &mdash; offering the freedom to switch to another service when one no longer fits the bill.</p>

<p>Another benefit of an adapter is you have the freedom to name the class and methods whatever you like. The base gem for a service might not have the best names, or it may be that the names don&rsquo;t make sense when dragged in to your application&rsquo;s domain. This is a small but important point as applications get larger and its code more complex. The more variable/method names you need to think about when you poke around the code, the harder it&rsquo;ll be to remember what was going on. Not to mention the pain new developers will have if they acquire the code. Whether it&rsquo;s you or the next developer, the time you invest in creating great names will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Using decorators in this way makes it easier for clients of the code to avoid change, but keep your applications flexible. The <code>Billing</code> class above was relatively simple &mdash; intentionally so. If the class being decorated has more than a few methods, it might be worth incorporating <code>SimpleDelegator</code> to ensure the methods that don&rsquo;t need additional functionality still continue to respond appropriately.</p>
