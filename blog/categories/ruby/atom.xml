    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This article was originally posted on the <a href="http://plumbing.pipelinedeals.com/">PipelineDeals Engineering
Blog</a></em></p>

<p>In the <a href="/blog/a-path-to-services-part-1-start-small/">previous article in this series</a>, we introduced a billing service to determine which features an account could access. If you remember, <a href="/our-path-to-services-part-1-start-small/">the email service</a> was a &ldquo;fire and forget&rdquo; operation and was capable of handling throughput delays given its low value to the core application.</p>

<p>This post will explore how we handle synchronous communication for a service like billing where an inline response is required to service a request from the core application.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>If you remember from the previous post, we introduced the billing service to an infrastructure that looked like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/services/app-email-billing.png" title="&ldquo;Web application with Email and Billing Microservice&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Handling multiple pricing tiers in a SaaS app means you have to control authorization based on account status. Our billing service encapsulates the knowledge of which features correspond to which pricing tier.</p>

<p>For instance, one feature is the ability to send trackable email to contacts in your PipelineDeals account. To service this request, we add an option to the bulk action menu from a list view:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/services/send-email.png" title="&ldquo;Send email feature&rdquo;" ></p>

<h2>Service Request</h2>

<p>Before we can conditionally show this option based on the pricing tier, we have to first make a request to the billing service to get the list of features available to that user.</p>

<p>```
class Billing::Features
  def initialize(user)</p>

<pre><code>@user = user
@account = user.account
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def list</p>

<pre><code>Rails.cache.fetch("account_#{account.id}_billing_features") do
  response = Billing::Api.get "account/#{account.id}/features"
  response['features']
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  private</p>

<p>  attr_reader :user, :account
end
```</p>

<p><code>Billing::Api</code>, in this case, is a wrapper around the API calls to handle exceptions and other information like security.</p>

<p><em>Note: When making synchronous HTTP calls like this, it&rsquo;s worth considering the failure state and providing a default response set in that case so the user isn&rsquo;t burdened with a failure page. In this case, one option would be dumb down the features on the page to the most basic tier.</em></p>

<h2>Serving a JSON API</h2>

<p>Plenty of articles have been written about how to create a JSON API with Rails, so we won&rsquo;t rehash those techniques here. Instead, we&rsquo;ll highlight patterns we&rsquo;ve used for consistency.</p>

<p>We tend to reserve the root URL namespace for UI-related routes, so we start by creating a unique namespace for the API:</p>

<p>```
namespace :api do
  resources :account do</p>

<pre><code>resource :features, only: :show
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>This setup gives us the path <code>/api/account/:account_id/features</code>. We haven&rsquo;t found a need for versioning internal APIs. If we decided to in the future, we could always add the API version as a request header.</p>

<p>The <code>features</code> endpoint looks like:</p>

<p>```
class Api::FeaturesController &lt; Api::ApiController
  skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token</p>

<p>  def show</p>

<pre><code>render json: {
  success: true,
  features: AccountFeatures.new(@account_id).list
}
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Notice <code>Api::FeaturesController</code> inherits from <code>Api::ApiController</code>. We keep the API-related functionality in this base controller so each endpoint will get access to security and response handling commonalities.</p>

<p><code>AccountFeatures</code> is a PORO that knows how to list billing features for a particular account. We could&rsquo;ve queried it straight from an ActiveRecord-based model, but our handling of features is a little more complicated than picking them straight from the database.</p>

<p>Another note here is that we haven&rsquo;t introduced a serializing library like <code>active_model_serializers</code> or <code>jbuilder</code>. Using <code>render json</code> alone has serviced us well for simple APIs. We reach for something more complex when the response has more attributes than shown above.</p>

<h2>Handling Service Response</h2>

<p>By introducing <code>Rails.cache</code>, we can serve requests (after the initial) without requiring a call to the billing service.</p>

<p>One of the first things we do is serialize the set of features to JavaScript so our client-side code has access:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;%= javascript_tag do %&gt;
  window.Features = &lt;%= Billing::Features.new(logged_in_user).list.to_json %&gt;;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>We also include a helper module in to our Rails views/controllers, so we can handle conditional feature logic:</p>

<p>```
module Features
  def feature_enabled?(feature)</p>

<pre><code>Billing::Features.new(logged_in_user).list.include?(feature.to_s)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h2>Synchronous Side Effects</h2>

<p>When we <a href="/our-path-to-services-part-2-synchronous-vs-asynchronous/">looked at asynchronous service requests</a>, there was less immediacy associated with the request due to its &ldquo;fire-and-forget&rdquo; nature. A synchronous request, on the other hand, will handle all requests to the core application, so scaling can be challenge and infrastructure costs can add up.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/services/synchronous-service-cost.png" title="&ldquo;Increased cost by introducing synchronous microservice&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>In addition to the infrastructure costs, performance can be a factor. If the original page response time was 100ms and we&rsquo;re adding a synchronous service request that takes another 100ms, all of a sudden we&rsquo;ve doubled our users' response times. And while this architectural decision might seem like an optimization, I&rsquo;m positive none of our users will thank us for making their page load times 2x slower.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>As you can see, there&rsquo;s little magic to setting up a synchronous service request.</p>

<p>Challenges appear when you consider failure states at every point in the service communication &ndash; the service could be down, or the HTTP request itself could fail due to network connectivity. As mentioned above, providing a default response during service failure is a great start to increasing the application&rsquo;s reliability. Optionally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker_design_pattern">the circuit break pattern</a> can provide robust handling of network failures.</p>

<p>Part 4 in this series will cover how we manage asynchronous communication between services, specifically around an <a href="https://github.com/PipelineDeals/mantle">open source gem we built called Mantle</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/a-path-to-services-part-2-synchronous-vs-asynchronous/"/>
    <updated>2015-08-14T10:32:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/a-path-to-services-part-2-synchronous-vs-asynchronous</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This article was originally posted on the <a href="http://plumbing.pipelinedeals.com/">PipelineDeals Engineering
Blog</a></em></p>

<p>In the <a href="/blog/a-path-to-services-part-1-start-small/">previous article in this series</a>, we moved the responsibility of emails to a separate Rails application. In order to leverage this new service, we created a PORO to encapsulate the specifics of communicating with our new service by taking advantage of Sidekiq&rsquo;s built-in retry mechanism to protect from intermittent network issues.</p>

<p>Communication between microservices can be broken down in to 2 categories: <strong>synchronous</strong> and  <strong>asynchronous</strong>.
Understanding when to use each is critical in maintaining a healthy infrastructure. This post will explore details about these two methods of communication and their associated use cases.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Continuing the discussion of our architecture from last time, we have a primary
Rails web application serving the majority of our business logic. We now have an additional application that&rsquo;s only responsibility is the formatting and sending of emails.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/services/app-email.png" title="&ldquo;Application service with email microservice&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll discuss the addition of our Billing service. The service&rsquo;s responsibility to is to process transactions related to money. This can come in the form of a trial conversion, adding a seat to an additional account, or deleting users from an existing account, among others.</p>

<p>Like many SaaS applications, PipelineDeals has multiple tiers of service. The most expensive intended for customers needing advanced functionality. Part of the billing service&rsquo;s responsibility is to manage the knowledge of which features an account can access.</p>

<p>So stepping back to the main PipelineDeals web application, the app has to decide which features to render at page load. Because the billing service is our source of truth for this information, a page load will now require a call to this service to understand which features to render.</p>

<p>This new dependency looks a little different than the email dependency from the
<a href="/blog/a-path-to-services-part-1-start-small/">previous article</a>. Email has the
luxury of not being in the dependency path of a page load. Very few customers
will complain if an email is 10 seconds late. On the other hand, they&rsquo;ll
complain immediately if their account won&rsquo;t load, and rightfully so.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/services/app-email-billing.png" title="&ldquo;Application service include email and billing microservices&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>An interesting benefit from having already extracted the email service is that the billing service sends email regarding financial transactions and account changes. Typically, we would have done the same thing for every other Rails app that needed to send email, which was integrate <code>ActionMailer</code> and setup the templates and mailers needed to do the work. In this case, we can add those emails to the email service and use the same communication patterns we do from the main web application to trigger the sending of an email from the billing service. This does require making changes to 2 different projects for a single feature (business logic in billing and mailer in email), but removes the necessity to configure another app to send email properly. We viewed this as a benefit.</p>

<h2>Asynchronous Events</h2>

<p>As the easier of the two, asynchronous would be any communication not necessary for the request/response cycle to complete. Email is the perfect example. Logging also falls in to this category.</p>

<p>For the networks gurus out there, this would be similar to UDP communication. More of a fire-and-forget approach.</p>

<p>An email, in this case, is triggered due to something like an account sign up.
We send a welcome email thanking the customer for signing up and giving them
some guidance on how to get the most benefit from the application. Somewhere in
the process of signing up, the code triggers an email and passes along the data
needed for email template.</p>

<p>As shown in the previous article, the call to send the email looks something like this:</p>

<p><code>ruby
Email.to current_user, :user_welcome
</code></p>

<p>The value in this call is that under the covers, it&rsquo;s enqueuing a Sidekiq job:</p>

<p><code>ruby
EmailWorker.perform_async(opts)
</code></p>

<p>where <code>opts</code> is a hash of data related to the email and the variables needed for the template.</p>

<p><em>Note: Because the options are serialized to JSON, values in hash must be simple structures. Objects won&rsquo;t work here.</em></p>

<p>As you can see above, the code invoking the <code>Email.to</code> method doesn&rsquo;t care about what it returns. In fact, it doesn&rsquo;t return anything we care about at this point. So as long as the method is called, the code can move forward without waiting for the email to finish sending.</p>

<p>Extracting asynchronous operations like this that exist in a code path is a
great way to improve performance. There are times, though, where deferring an operation to background job might not make sense.</p>

<p>For example, imagine a user changes the name of a person. They click one of their contact&rsquo;s names, enter a new name, and click &ldquo;Save&rdquo;. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to send the task of updating the actual name in the database to a background job because depending on what else is in the queue at that time, the update might not complete until after the next refresh, which would make the user believe their update wasn&rsquo;t successful. This would be incredibly confusing.</p>

<p>Logging is another perfect candidate for asynchronicity. In most cases, our users don&rsquo;t care if a log of their actions has been written to the database before their next refresh. It&rsquo;s information we may want to store, and as a result, can be a fire-and-forget operation. We can rest easy knowing we&rsquo;ll have that information, soon-ish, and it won&rsquo;t add any additional overhead to the end user&rsquo;s request cycle.</p>

<p>The opposite of asynchronous events like this are <strong>synchronous</strong> events! (surprise right?). Let&rsquo;s explore how they&rsquo;re different.</p>

<h2>Synchronous Events</h2>

<p>We can look at synchronous events as dependencies of the request cycle. We use MySQL as a backend for the main PipelineDeals web application and queries to MySQL would be considered synchronous. In that, in order to successfully fulfill the current request, we require the information returned from MySQL before we can respond.</p>

<p>In most cases, we don&rsquo;t think of our main datastore as a service. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have a separate application layer on top of it, but it&rsquo;s behavior and requirements are very much like a service.</p>

<p>If we consider the addition of our billing service above, we require information about the features allowed for a particular account before we can render the page. This allows us to include/exclude modules they should or should not see. The flow goes something like this:</p>

<p><code>Web request -&gt; lookup account in DB -&gt; Request features from Billing service -&gt; render page</code></p>

<p>If the request to the billing service didn&rsquo;t require a response, we would consider this to be an <strong>asynchronous</strong> service, which might change how we invoke the request for data.</p>

<p>Synchronous communication can happen over a variety of protocols. The most
common is a JSON payload over HTTP. In general, it&rsquo;s not the most performant,
but it&rsquo;s one of the easier to debug and is human-readable, so it tends to be pretty popular.</p>

<p>The synchronous services we&rsquo;ve setup all communicate over HTTP. Rails APIs are a known thing. We&rsquo;re familiar with the stack and the dependencies required to set up a common JSON API, which is a large part of the reason it&rsquo;s our preferred communication protocol between services.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve simplified the communication between services into these two categories. Knowing this helps dictate the infrastructure and configuration of the applications.</p>

<p>Next time, we&rsquo;ll take a closer look at the synchronous side and the specifics about the JSON payloads involved to send an email successfully.</p>

    <link href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/a-path-to-services-part-1-start-small/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-27T11:18:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/a-path-to-services-part-1-start-small</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This article was originally posted on the <a href="http://plumbing.pipelinedeals.com/">PipelineDeals Engineering
Blog</a></em></p>

<p>The PipelineDeals web application recently celebrated its ninth birthday. It&rsquo;s
seen its fair share of developers, all of whom had their own idea of &ldquo;clean
code&rdquo;. As a team, we&rsquo;d been brainstorming ways to wrangle certain areas of the
application. The question we&rsquo;d frequently ask ourselves was <em>&ldquo;How do we clean
up [x] (some neglected feature of the application)?</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Reasonable solutions ended up being:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rewrite it</li>
<li>Rewrite and put it elsewhere</li>
</ol>


<p>In short, we chose to rewrite many of the hairy areas of the app into separate services communicating over HTTP. It&rsquo;s been about a year since our first commit in a separate service, and we&rsquo;ve learned quite a bit since then. This is part 1 in a series of posts related to our transition to microservices.</p>

<h2>How we got here</h2>

<p>This was us 18 months ago. PipelineDeals was a crufty Rails 2 application that many of us were scared to open. It&rsquo;d been several years of adding feature upon feature without consistent knowledge, style, or guidance. And it&rsquo;s probably not surprising we had what we did. Regardless, we needed to fix it.</p>

<p>One of our goals was to move to Rails 3, and later more updated versions, but in order to get there, we had to refactor (or remove) quite a bit of code to make the transition easier.</p>

<p>This, to me, was a huge factor around our decision to move to a more service-focused approach. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJVTM7mE1Cc">At this year&rsquo;s Railsconf keynote</a>, DHH joked about the &ldquo;majestic monolith&rdquo; and how many companies prematurely piece out services, all to later suffer pain when they realize it was a premature optimization.</p>

<p>The same could be said for our move. Instead of spinning out separate services, we could have cleaned up the mess we had by refactoring every nasty piece of our app. We could have turned our ugly monolith into a majestic one. But while it would&rsquo;ve been possible, our team agreed we were better served by more or less starting over. Not in the big-bang rewrite sense, but instead to stand up brand new service apps when we added new features, and when it made sense. &ldquo;Made sense&rdquo; is the key here. There have been many times when it didn&rsquo;t make sense over the past 12 months. But we&rsquo;re learning and getting better at identifying the things that are good candidates for a more isolated service.</p>

<h2>Now what?</h2>

<p><em>Do we wait for the next requested feature or what?</em></p>

<p>At one of our weekly team hangouts, we watched a talk focused on starting by isolating the responsibility of Email. It was the perfect introduction and motivation for us to get a small win and some experience under our belts. For some reason prior, we didn&rsquo;t have a great sense of how to start making that transition.</p>

<p>The idea was to take our emails (and there were plenty) and move them to a separate Rails app that&rsquo;s only responsibilty is sending email. While it sounds trivial, the idea alone introduces a lot of interesting questions: <em>What do we do with those really nasty emails that have 30 instance variables? What do we do if the email service is down? How do we trigger an email to be sent?</em></p>

<h2>Rails new</h2>

<p>We created a new Rails 4 app, removed all the stuff we didn&rsquo;t need and created a golden shrine where emails could flourish&hellip;but seriously, that&rsquo;s all it did. And it did it really well.</p>

<p>The next question was how to send emails from the main application. We&rsquo;re very happy <a href="http://sidekiq.org/pro/">Sidekiq Pro</a> users, and one of the benefits we love about Sidekiq is the built-in retries. This gives us a layer of reliability outside of the code layer. So rather than build some ad-hoc retry mechanism by creating a counter in ruby, and rescuing failures within a certain range, we shoot off a job. If it fails because the network is down, or the endpoint isn&rsquo;t available, the job will retry soon after and continue down the happy path. Sidekiq retries are a recurring theme with our infrastructure. We&rsquo;ve made a number of decisions around the fact that we have this advantage already built-in, and we might as well take advantage of it. More on that to come.</p>

<h2>Communicate</h2>

<p>The defacto communication method between services is over HTTP. And we did nothing different. Our services use JSON payloads to exchange data, which let&rsquo;s us easily take advantage of Sidekiq on both ends.</p>

<p>So now, rather than invoking a built-in Rails mailer like:</p>

<p><code>
UserMailer.welcome(current_user).deliver
</code></p>

<p>we invoke a PORO to send off the communication:</p>

<p><code>
Email.to current_user, :user_welcome
</code></p>

<p>where <code>Email</code> is defined as</p>

<p>```
class Email
  def initialize(users, email_key, opts)</p>

<pre><code>@users, @email_key, @opts = users, email_key, opts
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def self.to(users, email_key, opts = {})</p>

<pre><code>new(users, email_key, opts).queue_email
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def queue_email</p>

<pre><code>opts[:email_key] = email_key
opts[:to] ||= email_array
opts[:name] ||= first_users_name
opts[:user_id] ||= user_id
opts[:account_id] ||= account_id

json = JSON.generate(opts)
RestClient.post(ENV["PIPELINE_EMAIL_URL"], json, :content_type =&gt; :json)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>There&rsquo;re a number of use-case specific variables above, but the <code>email_key</code> is probably the most important. We used that to describe what email should be invoked on the service.</p>

<p>In the above example, we triggered the <code>welcome</code> email on the <code>UserMailer</code> class. We translated this request into an email key of <code>user_welcome</code>.</p>

<p>This key then gets interpreted by the Email service app and turned into an actual <code>Mailer</code> class and method within it. We could have done this in a variety of ways, but we split the string on the service-side at the <code>_</code>, and the first element described the mailer, the rest the method. So in this case, it gets interpreted as <code>UserMailer#welcome</code>.</p>

<p>One thing this pattern allowed us to do was almost full copy/paste the old mailer methods in to the new Email service application.</p>

<h2>Failures, failures, failures</h2>

<p>&ldquo;What if the service is down?&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;the email request will fail!&rdquo; Sure will.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s wrap that request in a Sidekiq job to take advantage of the built-in retries.</p>

<p>Rather than invoke the following method in the email object:</p>

<p><code>
RestClient.post(ENV["PIPELINE_EMAIL_URL"], json, :content_type =&gt; :json)
</code></p>

<p>we&rsquo;ll shoot off a Sidekiq job instead, changing the <code>queue_email</code> method to:</p>

<p>```
def queue_email
  opts[:email_key] = email_key
  opts[:to] ||= email_array
  opts[:name] ||= first_users_name
  opts[:user_id] ||= user_id
  opts[:account_id] ||= account_id</p>

<p>  EmailWorker.perform_async(opts)
end
```</p>

<p>There we have it. Network-proof email requests!</p>

<p>Not so fast&hellip;</p>

<p>Astute readers will probably recognize that the service-side network communication can potentially also fail. This is becoming a pattern, huh? More communication, more potential for failure and more potential headaches.</p>

<p>On the <strong>service side</strong>, we have a controller that takes in the request for the email and immediately serializes it to a Sidekiq job:</p>

<p>```
  def create</p>

<pre><code>EmailWorker.perform_async(parsed_params)
head :accepted
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  private</p>

<p>  def parse_params</p>

<pre><code>JSON.parse(request.body) || {}
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Because we immediately serialize the job to Sidekiq, we&rsquo;ve successfully acknowledged the job was received, and the main app&rsquo;s Sidekiq job completes successfully. Now the email service can move on to doing the heavy-lifting in whatever way makes the most sense. In our case, we use Mailgun to send our emails, so the <code>EmailWorker</code> Sidekiq job invokes a new mailer based on the <code>email_key</code> param and sends it off to mailgun for transport. And because it&rsquo;s wrapped in a Sidekiq job, we can sleep well knowing that the Mailgun request can fail and the job will successfully retry until it goes through.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Service communication is definitely not for the faint of heart and as a team, we can completely appreciate the challenges that come along with keeping services in sync now&mdash;especially having stood up about 8 new services in the last 12 months.</p>

<p>Sidekiq has been the queueing solution we&rsquo;ve leaned on to keep communication in sync and reliable. We&rsquo;ve also written a few internal tools that piggy-backy off Sidekiq that we&rsquo;re really excited share with the community in the near future.</p>

<p>Part II, in this series, will discuss the methods of communication necessary to consider when implementing a service-based architecture.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to escape Javascript in a Rails application. From a tiny script to a full-on Javascript framework, websites are becoming more and more reliant on Javascript, whether we like it or not.</p>

<p>Several articles back, I documented <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/page-specific-javascript-in-rails/">how I handle page-specific Javascript in a Rails application</a>. My solution included a third-party jQuery plugin that did some magic on the <code>$(document).ready</code> function in combination with CSS style scoping to limit the functionality.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The plugin worked well for awhile, but with the advent of Turbolinks, the
solution felt less and less appropriate. I&rsquo;ve since settled on some techniques
to not only handle page-specific Javascript, but overall organization and structure of Javascript within a Rails application. I&rsquo;ve used it in a hand full of large applications over the past few months and it&rsquo;s held up incredibly well.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Using &ldquo;sprinkles&rdquo; of Javascript throughout a Rails application can get unwieldly fast if we&rsquo;re not consistent. What we ideally want is some techniques and guidelines that can keep the Javascript organized in our projects. <strong>We also don&rsquo;t want to have to disable Turbolinks to make our application work as we expect</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>Generally, javascript behavior can be boiled down to the following categories:</p>

<ol>
<li>Behavior that&rsquo;s &ldquo;always on&rdquo;</li>
<li>Behavior that&rsquo;s triggered from a user action</li>
</ol>


<p>But first, a few things to will help us stay organized&hellip;</p>

<h2>Class Scoping</h2>

<p>I still like to scope the body element of the layout(s) with the controller and action name:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;body class="&lt;%= controller_name %&gt; &lt;%= action_name %&gt;"&gt;
  &lt;%= yield %&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></p>

<p>This not only let&rsquo;s us control access to the DOM through jQuery if we need to, but also provides some top-level styling classes to allow us to easily add page-specific CSS.</p>

<p>In the case we&rsquo;re working on the proverbial blog posts application, the body tag ends up looking like:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;body class="posts index"&gt;
  &lt;%= yield %&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></p>

<p>This gives us the opportunity to scope CSS and Javascripts to all <code>posts</code>-related pages in the controller with the <code>.posts</code> class, or down to the specific page using a combination of both the controller and action: <code>.posts.index</code>.</p>

<h2>Default Application Manifest</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the default <code>app/assets/javascripts/application.js</code>:</p>

<p><code>
// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file.
//
// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.
//
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .
</code></p>

<p>I start by removing the line <code>//= require_tree .</code>. I do this because if you don&rsquo;t, the javascript files in the folder will be loaded in alphabetical order. As you&rsquo;ll see below, there&rsquo;s an initialization file that needs to be loaded before other Javascript. We&rsquo;ll also remove the comments from the top of the file to preserve space.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;re left with:</p>

<p><code>
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
</code></p>

<h2>Initialization</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by adding the file <code>app/assets/javascripts/init.coffee</code> with the following:</p>

<p>```
window.App ||= {}</p>

<p>App.init = &ndash;>
  $(&ldquo;a, span, i, div&rdquo;).tooltip()</p>

<p>$(document).on &ldquo;page:change&rdquo;, &ndash;>
  App.init()
```</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dig in to each pagef of this:</p>

<p><code>
window.App ||= {}
</code></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re creating the <code>App</code> object on window so the functionality added to the object is available throughout the application.</p>

<p>Next, we define an <code>init()</code> function on <code>App</code> to initialize common jQuery plugins and other Javascript libraries:</p>

<p><code>
App.init = -&gt;
  $("a, span, i, div").tooltip()
</code></p>

<p>The call to <code>$("a, span, i, div").tooltip()</code> initializes Bootstrap Tooltips. This is an example of the type of libraries that can/should be setup here. Obviously, if you&rsquo;re not using Bootstrap tooltips, you would haven&rsquo;t this here, but coupled with the next line, we&rsquo;ll see why this works.</p>

<p>As many have found out the hard way, <strong>when Turbolinks is enabled</strong> in a project, jQuery <code>$(document).ready</code> functions <strong>don&rsquo;t get fired from page to page</strong>. In order to call the <code>init()</code> function on each page transition, we&rsquo;ll hook in to the <code>page:change</code> event:</p>

<p><code>
$(document).on "page:change", -&gt;
  App.init()
</code>
<em>Note: the <code>page:change</code> transition is also triggered on the well known document ready event, so there&rsquo;s no need to add any special handling for first page load.</em></p>

<p>Lastly, we need to add <code>init.coffee</code> to the asset pipeline:</p>

<p><code>
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require init
</code></p>

<h2>&ldquo;Always On&rdquo; Javascript Functionality</h2>

<p>Now with the defaults out of the way, let&rsquo;s take a look at adding some behavior.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume one of our pages will show a Javascript graph of data. We&rsquo;ll start by adding a file with a name related to that responsibility.</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>app/assets/javascripts/app.chart.coffee</h1>

<p>class App.Chart
  constructor: (@el) &ndash;></p>

<pre><code># intialize some stuff
</code></pre>

<p>  render: &ndash;></p>

<pre><code># do some stuff
</code></pre>

<p>$(document).on &ldquo;page:change&rdquo;, &ndash;>
  chart = new App.Chart $(&ldquo;#chart&rdquo;)
  chart.render()</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>A few things to note here&hellip;</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>I created a class in the <code>App</code> namespace &mdash; the same we initialized in <code>app/assets/javascripts/init.coffee</code>. This gives us an isolated class that has a clear responsiblity. Like our Ruby, we want to do our best to keep its responsibilities to a minimium.</p>

<p>You might notice the file takes the form:</p>

<p>```
|
|
class definition
|
|</p>

<p>|
invocation
|
```</p>

<p>While this may seem obvious, it&rsquo;s an important point to keep in mind. I&rsquo;ve found it offers a predictable structure that allows me to open any coffeescript file that we&rsquo;ve written in the project and generally know where to look for what.</p>

<h3>Turbolinks-Proof</h3>

<p>We called this &ldquo;Always On&rdquo; functionality because, as you probably noticed, using the following event listener <code>$(document).on "page:change", -&gt;</code>, we know with Turbolinks, this gets triggered on every page transition.</p>

<h3>Add to Manifest</h3>

<p>Because we removed the <code>//= require_tree .</code> line in the default <code>application.js</code> manifest file, we&rsquo;ll have to add our chart file to be included in the asset pipeline (last line):</p>

<p><code>
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require init
//= require app.chart
</code></p>

<h3>Page-Specific Javascript</h3>

<p>Uh oh, so maybe we don&rsquo;t want the graph to show up on every page! In this case, we&rsquo;re looking for &ldquo;Always On&rdquo; functionality for specific pages <strong>ONLY</strong>.</p>

<p>We can limit the page pages certain functionality is loaded on by using the classes we added to the body of the layout. In this case, a small conditional to the invocation can prevent this being triggered on pages it shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>

<p><code>
$(document).on "page:change", -&gt;
  return unless $(".posts.index").length &gt; 0
  f = new App.Chart $("#chart")
  f.render()
</code></p>

<p>We added <code>return unless $(".posts.index").length &gt; 0</code> to make sure <code>App.Chart</code> never gets instantiated if we&rsquo;re on the <code>.posts.index</code> page. While this may seem verbose, I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s not very common to need page-specific functionality. There are probably plenty of libraries that do something similar, like <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/page-specific-javascript-in-rails/">the one I previously suggested</a>. <strong>However, to me, limiting javascript to a single page and very explicit when I read the code, it&rsquo;s almost never worth dragging in a separate plugin for this. YMMV.</strong></p>

<h2>User-Triggered Javascript</h2>

<p>This type of Javascript is exactly what you&rsquo;d think &mdash; Javascript invoked as a result of a user clicking or performing some type of action. You&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;I know how to do this, I&rsquo;ll just add a random file to the javascripts directory and throw in some jQuery&rdquo;. While this will functionally work just fine, I&rsquo;ve found that keeping the structure of these files similar will give you great piece of mind going forward.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;data-behavior&rdquo; Attribute</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume there&rsquo;s a link in the user&rsquo;s account that allows them to update their credit card. In this case, we have the following:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;%= link_to "Update Credit Card", "#", data: { behavior: "update-credit-card" } %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll probably notice the <code>data-behavior</code> tag being added to the link. This is the key we&rsquo;ll use to attach the Javascript behavior.</p>

<p>We could have added a unique class to the link:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;%= link_to "Update Credit Card", "#", class: "update-credit-card" %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>or, perhaps, even assign an ID:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;%= link_to "Update Credit Card", "#", id: "update-credit-card" %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Both of these techniques don&rsquo;t really indicate whether we added the <code>update-card-card</code> for the use of CSS styling, or to attach Javascript behavior. So in my applications, I leave classes for <strong>styling ONLY</strong>.</p>

<p>So now to the Javascript:</p>

<p>```
App.Billing =
  update: &ndash;></p>

<pre><code># do some stuff
</code></pre>

<p>$(document).on &ldquo;click&rdquo;, &ldquo;[data-behavior~=update-credit-card]&rdquo;, =>
  App.Billing.update()
```</p>

<p>We can use the selector <code>[data-behavior~=update-credit-card]</code> to latch on to the <code>data-behavior</code> tag we defined in the view. We use the <code>on</code> jQuery method to ensure that we&rsquo;re listening to this event whether the element&rsquo;s on the page or not. This is what allows us to load this Javascript when on other pages and have it still work when a user clicks through to the page with the actual link on it.</p>

<p>We could latch on to the <code>change</code> event, or whatever is appropriate to the element we&rsquo;re adding behavior.</p>

<h3>Add to Manifest</h3>

<p>Again, because Javascripts assets we add to <code>app/assets/javascripts</code> won&rsquo;t automatically be inserted in to the asset pipeline, we&rsquo;ll add <code>//= require app.billing</code> to the manifest file:</p>

<p><code>
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require init
//= require app.chart
//= require app.billing
</code></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Using the techniques above, we can keep the Javascript in our Rails applications organized and predictable. We can rest easy knowing the files will all generally look the same. There&rsquo;s not been any uses cases where this structure hasn&rsquo;t worked for me personally.</p>

<p>One thing that makes me feel good about this approach is there&rsquo;s no real magic or extra plugins. It&rsquo;s using all the tools we already have in a basic Rails application, which is one less thing to maintain and keep up to date. Less depedencies == less pain down the road.</p>
