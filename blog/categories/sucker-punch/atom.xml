    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a previous article, I <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/lessons-learned-from-building-a-ruby-gem-api/">documented the upcoming public API changes slated for Sucker Punch v2</a>. Because of a poor initial design, these API changes are <strong>backwards incompatible</strong>.</p>

<p>When I published the previous article, <a href="https://twitter.com/mperham/status/684529380446441472">Mike Perham rightly pointed out the opportunity to support the previous versions&rsquo;s API through an opt-in module</a>. I was hesitant to include support for the old syntax by default, but allowing a developer to require a file to get the old syntax made complete sense to me. My intent was never to abandon existing Sucker Punch users, but it felt necessary for the success of the project going forward.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The following is an example of enqueueing a background job with Sucker Punch using the old syntax:</p>

<p><code>
LogJob.new.async.perform("new_user")
</code></p>

<p>And with the new syntax:</p>

<p><code>
LogJob.perform_async("new_user")
</code></p>

<p><em>How do we support the old syntax in the new version?</em></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s step back and reminder ourselves of what a typical job class looks like:</p>

<p>```
class LogJob
  include SuckerPunch::Job</p>

<p>  def perform(event)</p>

<pre><code>Log.new(event).track
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Important points to notice:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each job includes the <code>SuckerPunch::Job</code> module to gain access to asynchronous behavior</li>
<li>Each job executes its logic using the <code>perform</code> instance method</li>
<li>Each job passes arguments needed for its logic as arguments to the <code>perform</code> instance method</li>
</ol>


<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start with the test:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>test/sucker_punch/async_syntax_test.rb</h1>

<p>require &lsquo;test_helper&rsquo;</p>

<p>module SuckerPunch
  class AsyncSyntaxTest &lt; Minitest::Test</p>

<pre><code>def setup
  require 'sucker_punch/async_syntax'
end

def test_perform_async_runs_job_asynchronously
  arr = []
  latch = Concurrent::CountDownLatch.new
  FakeLatchJob.new.async.perform(arr, latch)
  latch.wait(0.2)
  assert_equal 1, arr.size
end

private

class FakeLatchJob
  include SuckerPunch::Job

  def perform(arr, latch)
    arr.push true
    latch.count_down
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p><em>Note: Some details of this are complex because the job&rsquo;s code is running in another thread. I&rsquo;ll walk through those details in a future article.</em></p>

<p>The basic sequence is:
1. require <code>sucker_punch/async_syntax</code>
2. Execute a background job using the <code>async</code> syntax
3. Assert changes made in that job were successful</p>

<p>Running the tests above, we get the following error:</p>

<p><code>``
1) Error:
SuckerPunch::AsyncSyntaxTest#test_perform_async_runs_job_asynchronously:
LoadError: cannot load such file -- sucker_punch/async_syntax
  /Users/bhilkert/Dropbox/code/sucker_punch/test/sucker_punch/async_syntax_test.rb:6:in</code>require'
  /Users/bhilkert/Dropbox/code/sucker_punch/test/sucker_punch/async_syntax_test.rb:6:in `setup'</p>

<p>1 runs, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 1 errors, 0 skips
```</p>

<p>Ok, so the file doesn&rsquo;t exist. Let&rsquo;s create it and re-run the tests:</p>

<p><code>
1) Error:
SuckerPunch::AsyncSyntaxTest#test_perform_async_runs_job_asynchronously:
NoMethodError: undefined method `async' for #&lt;SuckerPunch::AsyncSyntaxTest::FakeLatchJob:0x007fbc73cbf548&gt;
  /Users/bhilkert/Dropbox/code/sucker_punch/test/sucker_punch/async_syntax_test.rb:12:in `test_perform_async_runs_job_asynchronously'
</code></p>

<p>Progress! The job doesn&rsquo;t have an <code>async</code> method. Let&rsquo;s add it:</p>

<p>```
module SuckerPunch
  module Job</p>

<pre><code>def async # &lt;--- New method
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p><em>Notice: We&rsquo;re monkey-patching the <code>SuckerPunch::Job</code> module. This will allow us to add methods to the background job since it&rsquo;s included in the job.</em></p>

<p>The tests now:</p>

<p><code>
1) Error:
SuckerPunch::AsyncSyntaxTest#test_perform_async_runs_job_asynchronously:
NoMethodError: undefined method `perform' for nil:NilClass
  /Users/bhilkert/Dropbox/code/sucker_punch/test/sucker_punch/async_syntax_test.rb:12:in `test_perform_async_runs_job_asynchronously'
</code></p>

<p>More progress&hellip;the <code>async</code> method we added returns nil, and because of the syntax <code>async.perform</code>, there&rsquo;s no <code>perform</code> method on the output of <code>async</code>. In short, we need to return something from <code>async</code> that responds to <code>perform</code> and can run the job.</p>

<p>In its most basic form, suppose we create a proxy object that responds to <code>perform</code>:</p>

<p><code>
class AsyncProxy
  def perform
  end
end
</code></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll need to do some work in <code>perform</code> to execute the job, but this&rsquo;ll do for now. Now, let&rsquo;s integrate this new proxy to our <code>async_syntax.rb</code> file and return a new instance of the proxy from the <code>async</code> method:</p>

<p>```
module SuckerPunch
  module Job</p>

<pre><code>def async
  AsyncProxy.new # &lt;--- new instance of the proxy
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  class AsyncProxy</p>

<pre><code>def perform
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Running our tests gives us the following:</p>

<p><code>
1) Error:
SuckerPunch::AsyncSyntaxTest#test_perform_async_runs_job_asynchronously:
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (2 for 0)
  /Users/bhilkert/Dropbox/code/sucker_punch/lib/sucker_punch/async_syntax.rb:9:in `perform'
  /Users/bhilkert/Dropbox/code/sucker_punch/test/sucker_punch/async_syntax_test.rb:12:in `test_perform_async_runs_job_asynchronously'
</code></p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re on to something. We see an error related to the number of arguments on the <code>perform</code> method. Because each job&rsquo;s argument list will be different, we need to find a way to be flexible for whatever&rsquo;s passed in, something like&hellip;the splat operator! Let&rsquo;s try it:</p>

<p>```
module SuckerPunch
  module Job</p>

<pre><code>def async
  AsyncProxy.new
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  class AsyncProxy</p>

<pre><code>def perform(*args) # &lt;--- Adding the splat operator, will handle any # of args
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The tests now:</p>

<p><code>
1) Failure:
SuckerPunch::AsyncSyntaxTest#test_perform_async_runs_job_asynchronously [/Users/bhilkert/Dropbox/code/sucker_punch/test/sucker_punch/async_syntax_test.rb:14]:
Expected: 1
Actual: 0
</code></p>

<p>At this point, we&rsquo;ve reached the end of test output suggesting the path forward. This error is saying, &ldquo;Your assertions failed.&rdquo;. This is good because it means our syntax implementation will work and it&rsquo;s just about executing the actual job code in the proxy&rsquo;s <code>perform</code> method.</p>

<p>We want to leverage our new syntax (<code>perform_async</code>) to run the actual job asynchronously so it passes through the standard code path. To do so, we&rsquo;ll need a reference to the original job in the proxy object. Let&rsquo;s pass that to the proxy during instantiation:</p>

<p>```
module SuckerPunch
  module Job</p>

<pre><code>def async
  AsyncProxy.new(self) # &lt;--- Pass the job instance
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  class AsyncProxy</p>

<pre><code>def initialize(job) # &lt;--- Handle job passed in
  @job = job
end

def perform(*args)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Now that the proxy has a reference to the job instance, we can call the <code>perform_async</code> class method to execute the job:</p>

<p>```
module SuckerPunch
  module Job</p>

<pre><code>def async
  AsyncProxy.new(self)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  class AsyncProxy</p>

<pre><code>def initialize(job)
  @job = job
end

def perform(*args)
  @job.class.perform_async(*args) # &lt;---- Execute the job
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Lastly, the tests:</p>

<p>```
ress ENTER or type command to continue
bundle exec rake test TEST=&ldquo;test/sucker_punch/async_syntax_test.rb&rdquo;
Run options: &mdash;seed 43886</p>

<h1>Running:</h1>

<p>.</p>

<p>1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```</p>

<p>Success!</p>

<p>Just like that, new users of Sucker Punch will be able to add <code>require 'sucker_punch/async_syntax'</code> to their projects to use the old syntax. This will allow existing projects using Sucker Punch to take advantage of the reworked internals without the need to make sweeping changes to the enqueueing syntax.</p>

<p>Support for the old syntax will be available for foreseeable future via this include. All new code/applications should use the new syntax going forward.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Before realizing a proxy object would work, I tinkered with <code>alias_method</code> and a handful of other approaches to latching on to the job&rsquo;s <code>perform</code> method and saving it off to execute later. While some combinations of these might have worked, the proxy object solution is simple and elegant. There&rsquo;s no magic, which means less maintenance going forward. The last thing I want is to make a breaking change, add support for the old syntax and find the support to be bug-ridden.</p>

<p>Ruby is incredibly flexible. Sometimes a 9-line class is enough to get the job done without reaching for an overly complex metaprogramming approach.</p>

<p>Having said all that, <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch">Sucker Punch <code>v2</code> has been

    <link href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/lessons-learned-from-building-a-ruby-gem-api/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-04T13:12:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/lessons-learned-from-building-a-ruby-gem-api</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sucker Punch was created because I had a <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/why-i-wrote-the-sucker-punch-gem/">need for background processing without a separate worker</a>. But I also figured others did too, given that adding a worker dyno on Heroku was $35. For hobby apps, this was a significant cost.</p>

<p>Having gotten familiar with Celluloid from my work on Sidekiq, I knew Celluloid had all the pieces to puzzle to make this easier. In fact, one of the earliest incarnations of Sucker Punch wasn&rsquo;t a gem at all, just some Ruby classes implementing the pieces of Celluloid necessary to put together a background processing queue.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The resulting code was less than ideal. It worked, but didn&rsquo;t feel like an API that anyone would want to use. From a beginner&rsquo;s perspective, this would stop adoption in its tracks. This is a common challenge with any code we encounter. No doubt, the Ruby standard library has all the tools necessary to make just about anything we can dream of, but sometimes the result isn&rsquo;t ideal. It&rsquo;s the same reason libraries like Rspec and HTTParty can exist. Developers prefer to use simplistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSLs</a> over convoluted, similarly-functioning code. Ruby has always been a language where developers consistently tout their ability to write code that reads well, feeding the levels of developer happiness.</p>

<h2>Why Rewrite Sucker Punch</h2>

<p>It started when <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch/issues/122">a version of Celluloid was yanked from RubyGems.org</a>. This resulted in a flurry of tweets and GH issues detailing their inability to bundle their applications.</p>

<p>As of version <code>0.17</code>, methods in public API changed without supporting documentation. On top of that, the core <code>celluloid</code> gem was split in to a series of child gems causing navigation to be painful.</p>

<p>This made my life as the Sucker Punch maintainer difficult. There were some requests to upgrade Sucker Punch to use Celluloid <code>~&gt; 0.17</code> and I feared of what would happen if I did. This caused me to think about what the future of Sucker Punch looked like without Celluloid. I still use Sucker Punch and believe it&rsquo;s a valuable asset to the community. My goal was to find a way to move it forward productively without experiencing similar pains.</p>

<p>In the end, thanks to some <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch/pull/126">communinity contributions</a>, <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch/blob/master/CHANGES.md#160">Sucker Punch <code>1.6.0</code> was released with Celluloid <code>0.17.2</code> support</a>.</p>

<h2>Where to now?</h2>

<p>Around that same time, Mike Perham had been writing about his experiences <a href="http://www.mikeperham.com/2015/10/14/optimizing-sidekiq/">optimizing Sidekiq</a> and <a href="http://www.mikeperham.com/2015/10/14/should-you-use-celluloid/">whether continuing with Celluloid made sense for Sidekiq</a>. Having less experience with multi-threading, it didn&rsquo;t make sense for me to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>I had been hearing about <a href="https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby"><code>concurrent-ruby</code></a> through a variety of outlets, one of which was Rails <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/20866">replacing the existing concurrency latch with similar functionality from <code>concurrent-ruby</code></a>. After poking around <code>concurrent-ruby</code>, I realized it had all the tools necessary to build a background job processing library. Much like Celluloid in that respect, had the tools, but lacked the simple DSL for the use case.</p>

<p>What if Sucker Punch used <code>concurrent-ruby</code> in place of <code>celluloid</code>?</p>

<p>I can hear what you&rsquo;re thinking&hellip;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference? You&rsquo;re swapping one dependency for another!&rdquo;. 100% true. The difference was that the little bit of communication I had with the maintainers of <code>concurrent-ruby</code> felt comfortable, easy, and welcoming. And with <code>concurrent-ruby</code> now a dependency of Rails, it&rsquo;s even more accessible for those using Sucker Punch within a Rails application (a common use case). But like before, there&rsquo;s no way to be sure that  <code>concurrent-ruby</code> won&rsquo;t cause similar pains/frustrations.</p>

<h2>Celluloid Basics</h2>

<p>A basic Sucker Punch job looks like:</p>

<p>```
class LogJob
  include SuckerPunch::Job</p>

<p>  def perform(event)</p>

<pre><code>Log.new(event).track
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>To run the job asynchronously, we use the following syntax:</p>

<p><code>
LogJob.new.async.perform("new_user")
</code></p>

<p>The most interesting part of this method chain is the <code>async</code>. Removing <code>async</code>, leaves us with a call to a regular instance method.</p>

<p>It so happens that <a href="https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/wiki/Basic-usage"><code>async</code> is a method in Celluloid that causes the next method to execute asynchronously</a>. And this works because by including <code>SuckerPunch::Job</code>, we&rsquo;re including <code>Celluloid</code>, which gives us the <code>async</code> method on instances of the job class.</p>

<h2>Developing APIs</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with the basics of Celluloid, you&rsquo;ll notice there&rsquo;s not much to Sucker Punch. It adds the Celluloid functionality to job classes and does some things under the hood to ensure there&rsquo;s one queue for each job class.</p>

<p><strong>Early in my <code>concurrent-ruby</code> spike, I realized what a mistake to tie Sucker Punch&rsquo;s API to the API of Celluloid</strong>. Tinkering with the idea of removing Celluloid has left Sucker Punch with two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Continue using the <code>async</code> method with the new dependency</li>
<li>Break the existing DSL and create a dependency-independent syntax and try my best to document and support the change through the backwards-incompatible change</li>
</ol>


<p>Option 1 is the easy way out. Option 2 is more work, far more scary, but the right thing to do.</p>

<p>I decided to abandon my thoughts about previous versions and write as if it were new today. This will be the basis for the next major release of Sucker Punch (<code>2.0.0</code>).</p>

<p>Settling on abandoning the existing API, the next question is, <strong>&ldquo;What should the new API look like?&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<p>Being a fan of Sidekiq, it didn&rsquo;t take long for me to realize it could actually make developers lives easier if Sucker Punch&rsquo;s API was the same.</p>

<p>Switching between Sidekiq and Sucker Punch is not uncommon. I look at Sidekiq as Sucker Punch&rsquo;s big brother and often suggest people use it instead when the use case makes sense.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with Sidekiq, using the <code>perform_async</code> class method should look familiar:</p>

<p><code>
LogJob.peform_async("new_user")
</code></p>

<p><strong>So why not use the same for Sucker Punch?</strong></p>

<p>If so, switching between Sidekiq and Sucker Punch would be no more than swapping <code>include Sidekiq::Worker</code> for <code>include SuckerPunch::Job</code> in the job class, aside from the gem installation itself. The result would be less context switching and more opportunity focus on the important parts of the application.</p>

<p>I can hear the same question again, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference? You suggested isolating yourself from a dependency&rsquo;s API and now you&rsquo;re suggesting using another!&rdquo;. I look at this one a little differently&hellip;</p>

<p>Sidekiq is uniquely positioned in the community as a paid open source project. We&rsquo;re happy users of Sidekiq Pro and continue to do so for the support. You can certainly get support for the open source version, but one way to ensure Sidekiq is actively maintained is by paying for it. This financial support from us and others decreases the likelihood Mike will choose to abandon it. Mike&rsquo;s also been public about his long-term interest in maintaining Sidekiq. With all this in mind, I&rsquo;m willing to bank on its existence as the defacto way to enqueue jobs for background processing.</p>

<p>And if for some reason Sidekiq does disappear, there&rsquo;s nothing lost on Sucker Punch. There&rsquo;s no dependency. Just a similar syntax.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch <code>2.0.0</code> will have 2 class methods to enqueue jobs:</p>

<p><code>
LogJob.perform_async("new_user")
</code></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><code>
LogJob.perform_in(5.minutes, "new_user")
</code></p>

<p>The latter defining a delayed processing of the <code>perform</code> method 5 minutes from now.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Settling on a library&rsquo;s API isn&rsquo;t easy. Isolating it from underlying dependencies is the best bet for long-term stability. Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter">adapter pattern</a> can help create a layer (adapter) between your code and the dependency&rsquo;s API. But like always, there are always exceptions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m taking a leap of faith that doing what I believe is right won&rsquo;t leave existing users frustrated, ultimately abandoning Sucker Punch altogether.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch <code>v2.0</code> is shaping up to be the best release yet. I&rsquo;m looking forward to sharing it with you.</p>

    <updated>2015-02-26T20:46:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/using-the-sucker-punch-ruby-gem-to-cache-stripe-data-in-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With so many services available these days, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to find or build an application that doesn&rsquo;t rely on a third-party service. Most developers that have dealt with billing systems within the past few years have likely heard of <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>. Stripe is, by far, the most developer-friendly billing service I&rsquo;ve implemented.</p>

<p>While Stripe does provide a number of features and plugins that make updating a credit card or signing up for a service simple, there are occasions when data needs to be fetched from Stripe in real-time. For these cases, it&rsquo;s great to be able to fetch and cache this data before-hand, and only expire if you know there&rsquo;s been a change.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Combining <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch">Sucker Punch</a> with Rails cache allows you to cache Stripe customer data so that billing pages are just as snappy as the rest of the application.</p>

<h2>The Pain</h2>

<p>Even though Stripe is generally pretty fast, retrieving customer data on the fly can be expensive. In order to optimize page load times, we can look to cache this data before it&rsquo;s actually used.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re familiary with the Stripe gem, you&rsquo;ve probably seen something like this:</p>

<p><code>
customer = Stripe::Customer.retrieve(user.stripe_id)
</code></p>

<p>With the response of <code>customer</code>, we can further query customer data with the following methods:</p>

<p><code>
invoices = customer.invoices
upcoming_invoices = customer.upcoming_invoices
</code></p>

<p>If we make all 3 of these method calls on page load, we&rsquo;d have 3 separate lookups from Stripe. This is pretty common for the typical billing page where you might want to show the customer&rsquo;s current credit card on file, their past invoices, and charges they can expect for the next invoice.</p>

<p>Three lookups like this could potentially add another second or so to page load, which is not ideal.</p>

<p>So how can we improve this?</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>First, we can move the code to fetch the relevant stripe data in to a class of it&rsquo;s own, which wraps the notion of caching around the data retrieval.</p>

<p>```
class StripeCache
  def initialize(user)</p>

<pre><code>@user = user
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def refresh</p>

<pre><code>purge_all
cache_all
self
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def customer</p>

<pre><code>return @customer if @customer

@customer = Rails.cache.fetch(cache_key("customer"), expires_in: 15.minutes) do
  Stripe::Customer.retrieve(user.stripe_id)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def invoices</p>

<pre><code>Rails.cache.fetch(cache_key("invoices"), expires_in: 15.minutes) do
  customer.invoices
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def upcoming_invoice</p>

<pre><code>Rails.cache.fetch(cache_key("upcoming_invoice"), expires_in: 15.minutes) do
  customer.upcoming_invoice
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  private</p>

<p>  attr_reader :user</p>

<p>  def cache_all</p>

<pre><code>customer
invoices
upcoming_invoice
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def purge_all</p>

<pre><code>Rails.cache.delete_matched("#{user.id}/stripe")
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def cache_key(item)</p>

<pre><code>"user/#{user.id}/stripe/#{item}"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>To use this on a billing page, we could do:</p>

<p><code>
stripe = StripeCache.new(current_user).refresh
</code></p>

<p>And from the response of that class, we could access the <code>customer</code>, <code>invoices</code>, and <code>upcoming_invoice</code> respectively:</p>

<p><code>
@customer = stripe.customer
@invoices = stripe.invoices
@upcoming_invoice = stripe.invoices
</code></p>

<p>This is great! All future calls to this customer&rsquo;s Stripe data will be fast &mdash; for 15 minutes, of course.</p>

<p>However, the first time the page is load, the user is still burdened with the initial fetch of the data. So the method above works for every request to the billing page after the first.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s be honest, what users are going to the billing page multiple times during a session? Probably not many. So we still need to fix the initial load somehow.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch">Sucker Punch</a> comes in. Like other Ruby background processing libraries, Sucker Punch allows you to move the processing of code to the background. However, unlike the others, Sucker Punch doesn&rsquo;t require additional infrastructure like Redis, and doesn&rsquo;t require a separate worker process to monitor and execute enqueued jobs. Because of this, the time it takes to extract code to a Sucker Punch job and have it incorporated with your application code is much lower.</p>

<p>In this case, rather than send a transactional email or perform some database calculation, we can write a job thats only responsibility is to run the Stripe caching code.</p>

<p>```
class StripeCacheJob
  include SuckerPunch::Job</p>

<p>  def perform(user)</p>

<pre><code>StripeCache.new(user).refresh
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The next question is, when do you run this?</p>

<p>Well, I chose to run it on user login, but you could run it anywhere you think would give you a head start if the user were about to go to the billing page. In my case, on login meant that if they didn&rsquo;t go to the billing page at all, after 15 minutes the data would be exhausted from the cache anyway, so no hard done.</p>

<p>But if the user did navigate to the billing page during that session, they would have up the latest Stripe customer and invoice data to see &mdash; all without a request to stripe on page load.</p>

<p>One other thing to keep in mind is there may be times when we&rsquo;d want invalidate the Rails cache data. One example would be when the user&rsquo;s card information is updated. In that case, we can slip in another call to the Stripe cache job, which would invalidate the previous cache and re-request the customer&rsquo;s billing information:</p>

<p>```
module Accounts
  class CardsController &lt; ApplicationController</p>

<pre><code>before_action :require_authentication

def create
  cust = StripeCache.new(current_user).customer
  cust.save(card: params[:stripeToken])

  StripeCacheJob.new.async.perform(current_user)

  redirect_to account_path, notice: t("card.update.success")
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Using Sucker Punch in combination with Rails cache feels like a great way make optimizations to third-party data requests. This article focused on using it to fetch Stripe data, but it could be used with another service just as easily.</p>

<p>The beauty of Sucker Punch is that it doesn&rsquo;t require a separate worker process to be running in the background. On a platform like Heroku, this saves the cost of an additional dyno.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch excels at background jobs that are relatively fast and if missed,
wouldn&rsquo;t be critical to the operation. In this case, if a cache job is lost,
it&rsquo;s not the end of the world. At worst, the user&rsquo;s Stripe data would be requested on the fly and the page would be slower than usual. But the majority of the time, the request is fast because the data&rsquo;s been cached beforehand.</p>

<p>What other jobs have you used Sucker Punch for?</p>

    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/absolutes-as-an-antipattern</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been awhile since my last post — almost 2 months to be specific. A trip to Portugal, getting sick and a minor run-in with a table saw made it challenging to post anything for the last couple weeks. But I’d be lying if I said I was itching to write.</p>

<p>During that time, I didn’t have anything screaming to be talked about. I have a long list of “decent post” topics, but none of them got me particularly excited. Until today…</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I stumbled on a blog post related to Rails’s upcoming <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html">Active Job feature</a>. While demonstrating the syntax for specifying the adapter, there was comment in the code snippet that said <em>“inline and other worse options”</em>. This caught me by surprise and bummed me out at the same time. Not only because I’m the author of <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch">one of them</a>, but because there are a handful of background processing libraries in Ruby that are really good.</p>

<p>So, naturally, I pinged the author and mentioned the comment might be sending the wrong message. He responded with “I consider sidekiq to be the best background processing tool available for Ruby.” And then later, <em>“sidekiq is significantly better that delayed_job and resque. You’re welcome to disagree”</em>.</p>

<p><em>Note: The responses above illustrate a general sentiment. By no means is this post focused on the individual that said them.</em></p>

<p>The thing is, I don’t completely disagree. As you probably already know, I’m a huge fan of of <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a>. I’ve contributed to the project and believe Sidekiq’s author, <a href="https://www.mikeperham.com/">Mike Perham</a> is not only a great leader in the Ruby community, but a great example of how to manage and lead open source projects well.</p>

<p>However, those responses reminded me how damaging absolutes can be. You’ve probably heard it before:</p>

<blockquote><p>“we can <strong>ABSOLUTELY NOT</strong> do x, y and z”</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Why not? Will the world end? How do I know?</em></p>

<p>or, what about:</p>

<blockquote><p>“this feature needs to go out tomorrow, no excuses”</p></blockquote>

<p><em>What if there is an excuse? What if it’s not ready? Will I be fired? Will our company go under?</em></p>

<p>There are trade-offs to every decision made. While some options may not be ideal, they may still work, perhaps just not as well.</p>

<p>Absolutes beg the toddler question, <em>”why?”</em>. <em>Why won’t that language X work?</em> <em>Why can’t we use Y?</em>. If you don’t know the answer to those questions, you’re doing yourself a disservice by not asking. Maybe the person has thoroughly researched the topic to come up with those conclusions. But, maybe, they haven’t.</p>

<p>I’ve noticed those who do exhaustive research on a topic tend to present the information in a different manner. They’re confident the facts they found will prove their case and seem to present their findings less defensively. No, <em>”it has to be done like this”</em>. More like, <em>“I found a few ways to fix the problem and here’s why I think option 1 might be the best solution. What do you think?”</em>.</p>

<p>Whether you follow agile or any other methodology, predictions and absolutes have no place in conversations. There are plenty of examples of failed software projects. I’m pretty sure all of them featured people promising the work would be done in time and under budget. Buuuuuuut, it wasn’t.</p>

<h2>Background Jobs for the Big Boys</h2>

<p>Delayed Job was the first Ruby background processing library I used. I remember feeling badass that I was doing all this complicated stuff in the background. But at some point, there we so many jobs and so much activity that pushing and pulling jobs out of the primary data store wasn’t efficient. Reads from the web UI would slow down (and ultimately stop) and users would bail. Unfortunately, I couldn’t pop up a message and say, <em>”hey, hope you don’t mind, but I’m doing some pretty crucial shit in the background here, so you’re experience is gonna be sucky for a bit! sorry :(”</em>.</p>

<p>So, at the time, Resque was the next logical transition. I migrated the previously written jobs from Delayed Job to Resque and experienced a new level of <em>bad ass</em>. Fast forward 4 years — I still work on projects using Resque. Needless to say, it’s a pretty awesome piece of open source software.</p>

<p>A few years ago, Sidekiq came along. While I didn’t know much about multi-threading code in Ruby, I tried it on a side project and was floored at the results. Those 6 Heroku workers that I’d been paying for could be compacted in to 1?!?! And on top of that, I only needed 1 worker that had 25 workers working against the queue?!?!</p>

<p>But then one day, I dropped it in to a project that was using MongoDB and MongoMapper as ORM and things didn’t go so well. In the end, MongoMapper wasn’t thread-safe, which is a requirement of Sidekiq worker code. So in that case, was Sidekiq the best tool for the job? While I would’ve loved to use Sidekiq on that project, it certainly (like the absolute there…) wasn’t the right tool for <em>that</em> job.</p>

<p>And what about when I first started with Delayed Job…we were a small startup with limited cash. While it seems silly to balk over an extra $35 Heorku dyno, it was $35 that could’ve gone towards something else. Not to mention the extra Redis instance, along with the expertise to make sure the thing didn’t fall over and die. Was Sidekiq (or Resque for that matter) the best tool for that job? Nope!</p>

<p>Fast forward a few years, I had the need for an in-process background processing library, so <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/why-i-wrote-the-sucker-punch-gem/">I wrote one</a>. That need was driven off the motivation above — needing to minimize cost and complexity. Would Sidekiq have worked for that project? Of course! In fact, it was using Sidekiq for a year or so before I transitioned the jobs to use Sucker Punch.</p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p>At this point, you should be noticing a trend, right? The examples above were unique use cases with a unique set of requirements and limitations. Sure, if every project I worked on had unlimited resources (both time and money), Sidekiq would be probably be my go-to the majority of time (even when writing that sentence I hesitated and almost wrote “all the time”).</p>

<p>But I hesitate now. Because I remember learning about the new cool things and thinking, <em>”This is the best! There’s no way I’ll never not use it”</em>. And when I would talk to other developers, I would rave about how <em>X</em> is the best for <em>Y</em>. And now I realize I was a dummy for doing that. There’s no way I could’ve made that judgement for someone else and their work. What I really should’ve said was, <em>”I tried [insert fancy new gem/technique] for the first time the other day. It worked really well for doing X in my project that does Y”</em>. That definitely doesn’t sound as exciting, but it was the truth.</p>

<p>I feel fortunate to get to write Ruby everyday. It’s incredibly expressive, which is why the debate over the countless ways to do something is great. Does the code express the right intent? For your method, it might. But for mine, it might express the complete opposite. The good news is, that’s OK. Both versions will work and the fact that we can have conversations like that is a praise for the language itself. I prefer to have the opportunity to have that conversation about style, rather than a language more black and white. Maybe it’s the creative in me, but it seems like no 2 Ruby solutions will be identical and that’s one of the things I love most about writing Ruby.</p>

<p>We often joke about the stack overflow post that starts with <em>“I’m thinking about learning Rails…is it better than PHP?”</em>. Or even more relevant today, <em>”Which javascript framework should I use?”</em>.</p>

<p>And then there’s the guy who comes along and is all like, <em>”Let’s back up, what are you doing and why do you absolutely need a FRAMEWORK????”</em>. While I used to ignore those types of comments, they’re the kind that I think about now and find myself typing. And that has me wondering…why the change?</p>

<h2>Experience, Experience, Experience</h2>

<p>I got to thinking about how I felt when I was first learning to program. When I started to feel comfortable with Rails, my confidence was through the roof. But at the same time, my naivety was at an all time high. I had had minimal experiences with software systems that were either critical or heavily-loaded. But having found Resque, I felt like I could solve the world’s problems. This is somewhat of an exaggeration, but not too far off. I realized that, as it relates to my technical career, my naivety is doing this related to time:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/absolutes/naivety-graph.png" title="&ldquo;Graph of Naivety over Time&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>The less naivety, the more options and, naturally, certainty takes a nose dive:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/absolutes/certainty-graph.png" title="&ldquo;Graph of Certainty over Time&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>The more I learn about programming in general, the more questions I have. Fortunately, experiences have brought me to a point where I can fairly weigh the use of Sucker Punch or Delayed Job for a particular use case. I’m not sure projecting absolutes from up high does anyone any good. Beginners will take it as the word and spread the message to others they come across.</p>

<p>Use cases are real. And the less we force our own biases on people, the faster they’ll realize experience is key and the random guy behind the cat avatar on Stack Overflow might actually be asking the right questions — even if they are convoluted.</p>

<p>Next time you hear an absolute, ask <em>”Why?”</em>.</p>

    <link href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/rails-reloader-a-lesser-known-railtie-hook/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-21T19:48:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/rails-reloader-a-lesser-known-railtie-hook</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently wrote <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/books/build-a-ruby-gem/?utm_source=bh-come&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=reloader">a book about integrating with Rails from a Ruby gem</a>, which specifically touched on using a <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Rails/Railtie.html">Railtie</a> to extend <code>ActiveRecord</code>, <code>ActionController</code> and <code>ActionView</code> . While these are the 3 more popular Rails libraries, there’s plenty others <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html">that are configurable</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch/issues/49">recent issue</a> in <a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch">Sucker Punch</a> caused me to go digging through the Rails source code. Ultimately, the <code>to_prepare</code> method on <code>ActionDispatch::Reloader</code> resolved the issue, but I surprised was to find very little documentation about it.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch">Sucker Punch</a> lazily creates the <a href="https://celluloid.io/">Celluloid</a> pools used for background job queues. For the purpose of keeping track of the queues already initialized, Sucker Punch makes use of the <a href="https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/wiki/Registry">Celluloid Registry</a>. Think of it as a class-level hash.</p>

<p>This works swimmingly in production, but not so much in development. Rails makes our lives easier by reloading code in between requests while in development, due to this setting in <code>config/environments/development.rb</code>:</p>

<p><code>
  config.cache_classes = false
</code></p>

<p>Without it, we’d be forced to restart the server after almost every request. If that sounds like a giant PITA to you, I whole heartedly agree!</p>

<p>So now you make your awesome job class, do some background work (send an email for example) and reload the page and boom:</p>

<p><code>``
Celluloid::PoolManager: async call</code>perform` aborted!
ArgumentError: A copy of SendInvitationJob has been removed from the module tree but is still active!</p>

<pre><code>    gems/activesupport-4.0.3/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:446:in `load_missing_constant'
    gems/activesupport-4.0.3/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:184:in `const_missing'
    my-app/app/jobs/send_invitation_job.rb:6:in `block in perform'
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The Celluloid registry still has reference to a the original <code>SendInvitationJob</code> class when it was initialized, however, reloading the code has caused the original reference to disappear and all hell breaks loose when the queue key is fetched to send another job to the class.</p>

<p>In my head, it made sense for the queues to be cleared out upon every request in development. In general, because Sucker Punch doesn’t have persistent queues, the best use case is for quick one-off jobs that aren’t extremely important — email and logging come to mind. Since both of these examples are typically pretty speedy, it’s unlikely there will be a huge job backup upon subsequent requests.</p>

<p>I knew what I wanted, but didn’t know how to accomplish it.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>Knowing the issue was related to the setting <code>config.cache_classes = false</code> in the development environment, I broke open the Rails source code and searched for <code>cache_classes</code>. The first result was the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/reloader.rb"><code>ActionDispatch</code> reloader middleware</a>. Fortunately, there’s a very descriptive comment at the top of the class:</p>

<p><code>
  # By default, ActionDispatch::Reloader is included in the middleware stack
  # only in the development environment; specifically, when +config.cache_classes+
  # is false. Callbacks may be registered even when it is not included in the
  # middleware stack, but are executed only when &lt;tt&gt;ActionDispatch::Reloader.prepare!&lt;/tt&gt;
  # or &lt;tt&gt;ActionDispatch::Reloader.cleanup!&lt;/tt&gt; are called manually.
</code></p>

<p>This functionality is exactly what I needed!. From here, I just needed to know what callbacks were valid. A few lines in to the class are the following methods:</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code># Add a prepare callback. Prepare callbacks are run before each request, prior
# to ActionDispatch::Callback's before callbacks.
def self.to_prepare(*args, &amp;block)
  unless block_given?
    warn "to_prepare without a block is deprecated. Please use a block"
  end
  set_callback(:prepare, *args, &amp;block)
end

# Add a cleanup callback. Cleanup callbacks are run after each request is
# complete (after #close is called on the response body).
def self.to_cleanup(*args, &amp;block)
  unless block_given?
    warn "to_cleanup without a block is deprecated. Please use a block"
  end
  set_callback(:cleanup, *args, &amp;block)
end
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p><code>to_prepare</code> and <code>to_cleanup</code>…and like the comments say, they do exactly what you’d expect. Given that I wanted to clear our the Celluloid registry BEFORE each request, <code>on_prepare</code> is the golden ticket. Now I just needed to figure out how to clear the registry.</p>

<p>A quick glade over the <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/celluloid/Celluloid/Registry"><code>Celluloid::Registry</code> class documentation</a> shows some methods that might be of value. It turns out that these are instance methods for an instance of the <code>Celluloid::Registry</code> class. Unfortunately, when Celluloid boots, it instantiates a registry to use internally, so we need a way to get at that particular instance and clear it out. Sure enough, <a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/celluloid/Celluloid/Actor#clear_registry-class_method">a class method to do just that in <code>Celluloid::Actor</code></a> is available.</p>

<p>Now that we all the pieces of the puzzle, it was time to put together a Railtie to trigger the behavior. Prior to needing this functionality, the Railtie in Sucker Punch was pretty simple:</p>

<p>```
module SuckerPunch
  class Railtie &lt; ::Rails::Railtie</p>

<pre><code>initializer "sucker_punch.logger" do
  SuckerPunch.logger = Rails.logger
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>All it did was connect the logger to the existing Rails logger. Adding the callback to <code>ActionDispatch</code> looks like:</p>

<p>```
module SuckerPunch
  class Railtie &lt; ::Rails::Railtie</p>

<pre><code>initializer "sucker_punch.logger" do
  SuckerPunch.logger = Rails.logger
end

config.to_prepare do
  Celluloid::Actor.clear_registry
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Now when the Railtie is loaded, the <code>Celluloid::Actor.clear_registry</code> method is triggered before the reloading of code in the development environment, clearing out the Celluloid registry and allowing Sucker Punch to instantiate new job queues for each request.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I was unaware of any of these methods when the issue was submitted. Rather than throw my hands up and close the issue because it didn’t affect me, I thought through an approach that could work, and only then started to write code. And in fact, didn’t know what code to write!</p>

<p>Comments and well written code serve as great documentation. I probably wouldn’t have stumbled on <code>ActionDispatch::Reloader</code> without the detailed comments at the top of the class. Sure, I would’ve found the <code>cache_classes</code> line, but might not have given it more thought.</p>

<p>Next time you have a question about the syntax of a method or the order of its arguments, clone the repo (if it’s open source, of course) and do a search. I think you’ll be surprised at how quickly you can find what you’re looking for. My guess is you’ll also be pleasantly surprised at the other things you stumble upon in the process.</p>
